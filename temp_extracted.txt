The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You

What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that helps 
taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. TAS strives to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and 
understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 

What can TAS do for you?
TAS can help you if your tax problem is causing a financial difficulty, you've tried and been unable to resolve your issue with 
the IRS, or you believe an IRS system, process, or procedure just isn't working as it should. And the service is free. If you 
qualify for TAS assistance, you will be assigned to one advocate who will work with you throughout the process and will do 
everything possible to resolve your issue. TAS can help you if:

• Your problem is causing a financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business.
• You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
• You’ve tried to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.

How can you reach TAS?
TAS has offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To find your advocate’s number:

• Go to TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/contact-us;
• Download Publication 1546, Taxpayer Advocate Service - We Are Here to Help You. If you do not have Internet access, 

you can call the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676) and ask for a copy of Publication 1546;

• Check your local directory; or
• Call TAS toll free at 877-777-4778.

How can you learn about your taxpayer rights?
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes ten basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. The TAS website 
TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov can help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your rights. 
Know them. Use them.

How else does the Taxpayer Advocate Service help taxpayers?
TAS works to resolve large-scale problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues, please report it 
to TAS at IRS.gov/SAMS. Be sure not to include any personal taxpayer information.

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Taxpayer Advocate 
Service (TAS). LITCs represent individuals whose income is below a certain level and who need to resolve tax problems with 
the IRS. LITCs can represent taxpayers in audits, appeals, and tax collection disputes before the IRS and in court. In addition, 
LITCs can provide information about taxpayer rights and responsibilities in different languages for individuals who speak 
English as a second language. Services are offered for free or a small fee. For more information or to find an LITC near you, see 
the LITC page at TaxpayerAdvocate.IRS.gov/LITCMap or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income Taxpayer Clinic List. This 
publication is available online at IRS.gov/Forms-Pubs or by calling the IRS toll free at 800-TAX-FORM (800-829-3676). 

Suggestions for Improving the IRS

Taxpayer Advocacy Panel

Taxpayers have an opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) through the Taxpayer Advocacy 
Panel (TAP). The TAP is a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of an independent panel of citizen volunteers who listen to 
taxpayers, identify taxpayers' systemic issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS customer service. Contact TAP at 
ImproveIRS.org.

Affordable Care Act—What You Need To KnowRequirement To Reconcile Advance Payments of the Premium Tax CreditThe premium tax credit helps pay premiums for health insurance purchased from the Marketplace. Eligible individuals may have advance payments of the premium tax credit made on their behalf directly to the insurance company.If you or a family member enrolled in health insurance through the Marketplace and advance payments of the premium tax credit were made to your insurance company to reduce your monthly premium payment, you must attach Form 8962 to your return to reconcile (compare) the advance payments with your premium tax credit for the year.The Marketplace is required to send Form 1095-A by January 31, 2023, listing the advance payments and other information you need to complete Form 8962.1. You will need Form 1095-A from the Marketplace.2. Complete Form 8962 to claim the credit and to reconcile your advance credit payments.3. Include Form 8962 with your Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, or Form 1040-NR. (Don’t include Form 1095-A.)Health Coverage ReportingIf you or someone in your family was an employee in 2022, the employer may be required to send you Form 1095-C. Part II of Form 1095-C shows whether your employer offered you health insurance coverage and, if so, information about the offer. You should receive Form 1095-C by early March 2023. This information may be relevant if you purchased health insurance coverage for 2022 through the Health Insurance Marketplace and wish to claim the premium tax credit on Schedule 3, line 9. However, you don’t need to wait to receive this form to file your return. You may rely on other information received from your employer. If you don’t wish to claim the premium tax credit for 2022, you don’t need the information in Part II of Form 1095-C. For more information on who is eligible for the premium tax credit, see the Instructions for Form 8962.Reminder: Health care coverage. If you need health care coverage, go to www.HealthCare.gov to learn about health insurance options for you and your family, how to buy health insurance, and how you might qualify to get financial assistance to buy health insurance.Page 6 of 113  Fileid: … ions/i1040/2022/a/xml/cycle11/source

For information about any additional changes to the 2022 tax law or any other devel-
opments  affecting  Form  1040  or  1040-SR  or  the  instructions,  go  to  IRS.gov/
Form1040.

Due date of return.  File Form 1040 or 
1040-SR  by  April  18,  2023.  The  due 
date is April 18, instead of April 15, be-
cause  of  the  Emancipation  Day  holiday 
in the District of Columbia – even if you 
don’t live in the District of Columbia.
Filing status name changed to qualify-
ing  surviving  spouse.  The  filing  status 
qualifying widow(er) is now called qual-
ifying  surviving  spouse.  The  rules  for 
the  filing  status  have  not  changed.  The 
same  rules  that  applied  for  qualifying 
widow(er) apply to qualifying surviving 
spouse. See Qualifying surviving spouse, 
later.
Standard  deduction  amount 
in-
creased.  For  2022,  the  standard  deduc-
tion  amount  has  been  increased  for  all 
filers. The amounts are:

• Single  or  Married  filing  separate-

ly—$12,950.

• Married  filing  jointly  or  Qualify-

ing surviving spouse—$25,900.

• Head of household—$19,400.
New  lines  1a  through  1z  on  Form 
1040  and  1040-SR.  This  year  line  1  is 
expanded  and  there  are  new  lines  1a 
through  1z.  Some  amounts  that  in  prior 
years  were  reported  on  Form  1040  and 
Form  1040-SR  are  now  reported  on 
Schedule 1.

• Scholarship  and  fellowship  grants 
that  were  not  reported  to  you  on  Form 
W-2  are  now  reported  on  Schedule  1, 
line 8r.

lified  deferred  compensation  plan  or  a 
nongovernmental  section  457  plan  are 
now reported on Schedule 1, line 8t.

• Wages  earned  while  incarcerated 
are now reported on Schedule 1, line 8u.
New 
line  6c  on  Form  1040  and

lump-sum election method for their ben-
efits  will  check  this  box.  See  Line  6c, 
later.

structions  for  Schedule  8812  (Form 
1040).
Changes  to  the  earned  income  credit 
(EIC).  The enhancements for taxpayers 
without  a  qualifying  child  that  applied 
for  2021  don’t  apply  for  2022.  This 
means, to claim the EIC without a quali-
fying child in 2022 you must be at least 
age  25  but  under  age  65  at  the  end  of 
2022.  If  you  are  married  and  filing  a 
joint  return,  either  you  or  your  spouse 
must be at least age 25 but under age 65 
at  the  end  of  2022.  It  doesn’t  matter 
which  spouse  meets  the  age  require-
ment, as long as one of the spouses does.
Reporting  requirements  for  Form 
1099-K.  Form 1099-K is issued by third 
party settlement organizations and credit 
card companies to report payment trans-
actions made to you for goods and serv-
ices.

You  must  report  all  income  on  your 
tax  return  unless  excluded  by  law, 
whether  you  received  the  income  elec-
tronically  or  not,  and  whether  you  re-
ceived  a  Form  1099-K  or  not.  The 
box  1a  and  other  amounts  reported  on 
Form 1099-K are additional pieces of in-
formation  to  help  determine  the  correct 
amounts to report on your return.

If  you  received  a  Form  1099-K  that 
shows payments you didn’t receive or is 
otherwise  incorrect,  contact  the  Form 
1099-K  issuer.  Don’t  contact  the  IRS; 
the  IRS  can’t  correct  an  incorrect  Form 
1099-K. If you can’t get it corrected, or 
you  sold  a  personal  item  at  a  loss,  see 
the instructions for Schedule 1, lines 8z 
and 24z, later, for more reporting infor-
mation.

All  IRS 

information  about  Form 
1099-K is available by going to IRS.gov/
1099K.

were excluded from income on Schedule 
1, line 8z. For 2022, nontaxable amounts 
will be excluded on Schedule 1, line 8s.
Nontaxable  combat  pay  election.  For 
2021, individuals elected to include their 
nontaxable  combat  pay  in  their  earned 
income  when  figuring  the  earned  in-
come  credit  (EIC)  by  reporting  it  on 
Form  1040  or  1040-SR,  line  27b.  For 
2022, they will make this election by re-
porting nontaxable combat pay on Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 1i.
Credits  for  sick  and  family  leave  for 
certain  self-employed  individuals  are 
not  available.  Self-employed  individu-
als can no longer claim these credits.
Health  coverage  tax  credit  is  not 
available.  The  health  coverage 
tax 
credit  was  not  extended.  The  credit  is 
not available after 2021.
Credit  for  child  and  dependent  care 
expenses.  The changes to the credit for 
child  and  dependent  care  expenses  im-
plemented by the American Rescue Plan 
Act  of  2021  (ARP),  were  not  extended. 
For 2022, the credit for the child and de-
pendent care expenses is nonrefundable. 
The  dollar  limit  on  qualifying  expenses 
is  $3,000  for  one  qualifying  person  and 
$6,000  for  two  or  more  qualifying  per-
sons.  The  maximum  credit  amount  al-
lowed is 35% of your employment-rela-
ted expenses. For more information, see 
the Instructions for Form 2441 and Pub. 
503.
Child  tax  credit  and  additional  child 
tax  credit.  Many  changes  to  the  child 
tax  credit  (CTC)  implemented  by  ARP 
were not extended. For 2022,

• The  initial  credit  amount  of  the 
CTC is $2,000 for each qualifying child.
• The  amount  of  CTC  that  can  be 
claimed as a refundable credit is limited 
as  it  was  in  2020,  except  the  maximum 
tax  credit  (ACTC) 
additional  child 
amount has increased to $1,500 for each 
qualifying child.

• A  child  must  be  under  age  17  at 
the end of 2022 to be a qualifying child.
• Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico 
are  no  longer  required  to  have  three  or

Pub.  501  if  you  do  not  have  to  file  but 
received  a  Form  1099-B  (or  substitute 
statement).
Requirement  to  reconcile  advance 
payments  of  the  premium  tax  credit. 
If you, your spouse with whom you are 
filing a joint return, or a dependent was 
enrolled  in  coverage  through  the  Mar-
ketplace for 2022 and advance payments 
of the premium tax credit were made for 
this  coverage,  you  must  file  a  2022  re-
turn  and  attach  Form  8962.  You  (or 
whoever  enrolled  you)  should  have  re-
ceived  Form  1095-A  from  the  Market-
place  with  information  about  your  cov-
erage and any advance payments.

You  must  attach  Form  8962  even  if 
someone else enrolled you, your spouse, 
or your dependent. If you are a depend-
ent  who  is  claimed  on  someone  else's 
2022  return,  you  do  not  have  to  attach 
Form 8962.
Exception  for  certain  children  under 
age 19 or full-time students.  If certain 
conditions  apply,  you  can  elect  to  in-

clude  on  your  return  the  income  of  a 
child  who  was  under  age  19  at  the  end 
of 2022 or was a full-time student under 
age 24 at the end of 2022. To do so, use 
Form  8814.  If  you  make  this  election, 
your  child  doesn't  have  to  file  a  return. 
For  details,  use  Tax  Topic  553  or  see

A  child  born  on  January  1,  1999,  is 
considered  to  be  age  24  at  the  end  of 
2022. Do not use Form 8814 for such a 
child.

Resident aliens.  These rules also apply 
if  you  were  a  resident  alien.  Also,  you 
may  qualify  for  certain  tax  treaty  bene-
fits. See Pub. 519 for details.

Nonresident aliens and dual-status ali-
ens.  These rules also apply if you were 
a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien 
and both of the following apply.

• You were married to a U.S. citizen 

or resident alien at the end of 2022.

• You  elected  to  be  taxed  as  a  resi-

dent alien.
See Pub. 519 for details.

Specific  rules  apply  to  deter-
mine if you are a resident alien, 
nonresident  alien,  or  dual-sta-
tus  alien.  Most  nonresident  aliens  and 
dual-status  aliens  have  different  filing 
requirements and may have to file Form 
1040-NR.  Pub.  519  discusses  these  re-
quirements  and  other  information  to 
help aliens comply with U.S. tax law.

If  you  e-file  your  return,  there  is  no 
need to mail it. However, if you choose 
to mail it instead, filing instructions and 
addresses are at the end of these instruc-
tions.

The chart at the end of these in-
structions  provides  the  current 
address  for  mailing  your  re-
turn.  Use  these  addresses  for  Forms 
1040 or 1040-SR filed in 2023. The ad-
dress for returns filed after 2023 may be 
different. See IRS.gov/Form1040 for any 
updates.

What if You Can't File on 
Time?
You  can  get  an  automatic  6-month  ex-
tension if, no later than the date your re-
turn is due, you file Form 4868. For de-
tails,  see  Form  4868.  Instead  of  filing 
Form  4868,  you  can  apply  for  an  auto-
matic extension by making an electronic 
payment by the due date of your return.

An  automatic  6-month  exten-
sion  to  file  doesn't  extend  the 
time  to  pay  your  tax.  If  you 
don’t  pay  your  tax  by  the  original  due 
date of your return, you will owe interest 
on  the  unpaid  tax  and  may  owe  penal-
ties. See Form 4868.

If  you  are  a  U.S.  citizen  or  resident 
alien, you may qualify for an automatic 
extension  of  time  to  file  without  filing 
Form  4868.  You  qualify  if,  on  the  due 
date of your return, you meet one of the 
following conditions.

• You live outside the United States 
and Puerto Rico and your main place of 
business  or  post  of  duty  is  outside  the 
United States and Puerto Rico.

• You  are  in  military  or  naval  serv-
ice on duty outside the United States and 
Puerto Rico.

This  extension  gives  you  an  extra  2 
months to file and pay the tax, but inter-
est will be charged from the original due 
date  of  the  return  on  any  unpaid  tax. 
You  must  include  a  statement  showing 
that  you  meet  the  requirements.  If  you 
are still unable to file your return by the 
end  of  the  2-month  period,  you  can  get 
an  additional  4  months  if,  no  later  than 
June 15, 2023, you file Form 4868. This

*If you were born on January 1, 1958, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2022. (If your spouse died in 2022 or 
if you are preparing a return for someone who died in 2022, see Pub. 501.)
**Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from 
tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can 
exclude part or all of it). Don’t include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and 
you lived with your spouse at any time in 2022, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross 
income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the 
instructions for lines 6a and 6b to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. 
Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a business means, 
for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, don’t reduce your 
income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
***If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2022 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at 
least $5, you must file a return regardless of your age.

Filing Status
Check only the filing status that applies 
to  you.  The  ones  that  will  usually  give 
you the lowest tax are listed last.
• Married filing separately.
• Single.
• Head of household.
• Married filing jointly.
• Qualifying surviving spouse.

For information about marital status, see 
Pub. 501.

More than one filing status can 
apply  to  you.  You  can  choose 
the  one  that  will  give  you  the 

lowest tax.

Single
You  can  check  the  “Single”  box  at  the 
top  of  Form  1040  or  1040-SR  if  any  of 
the following was true on December 31, 
2022.

• You were never married.
• You were legally separated accord-
ing  to  your  state  law  under  a  decree  of 
divorce or separate maintenance. But if, 
at  the  end  of  2022,  your  divorce  wasn't 
final  (an  interlocutory  decree),  you  are 
considered  married  and  can't  check  the 
box.

• You were widowed before January 
1,  2022,  and  didn't  remarry  before  the 
end  of  2022.  But  if  you  have  a  child, 
you  may  be  able  to  use  the  qualifying 
surviving  spouse  filing  status.  See  the 

instructions  for  Qualifying  Surviving 
Spouse, later.

Married Filing Jointly
You can check the “Married filing joint-
ly”  box  at  the  top  of  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR if any of the following apply.

• You  were  married  at  the  end  of 
2022,  even  if  you  didn't  live  with  your 
spouse at the end of 2022.

• Your spouse died in 2022 and you 

didn't remarry in 2022.

• You  were  married  at  the  end  of 
2022  and  your  spouse  died  in  2023  be-
fore filing a 2022 return.

A married couple filing jointly report 
their combined income and deduct their 
combined allowable expenses on one re-
turn. They can file a joint return even if 
only  one  had  income  or  if  they  didn't 
live  together  all  year.  However,  both 
persons  must  sign  the  return.  Once  you 
file  a  joint  return,  you  can't  choose  to 
file  separate  returns  for  that  year  after 
the due date of the return.
Joint  and  several  tax  liability.  If  you 
file  a  joint  return,  both  you  and  your 
spouse  are  generally  responsible  for  the 
tax  and  interest  or  penalties  due  on  the 
return.  This  means  that  if  one  spouse 
doesn't  pay  the  tax  due,  the  other  may 
have to. Or, if one spouse doesn't report 
the correct tax, both spouses may be re-
sponsible  for  any  additional  taxes  as-
sessed by the IRS. You may want to file 
separately if:

• You  believe  your  spouse  isn't  re-

porting all of their income, or

• You  don’t  want  to  be  responsible 
for any taxes due if your spouse doesn't 
have enough tax withheld or doesn't pay 
enough estimated tax.
See  the  instructions  for  Married  Filing 
Separately.  Also  see  Innocent  Spouse 
Relief under General Information, later.

Nonresident aliens and dual-status ali-
ens.  Generally,  a  married  couple  can't 
file  a  joint  return  if  either  spouse  is  a 
nonresident alien at any time during the 
year.  However,  if  you  were  a  nonresi-
dent alien or a dual-status alien and were 
married to a U.S. citizen or resident ali-
en  at  the  end  of  2022,  you  can  elect  to 
be  treated  as  a  resident  alien  and  file  a 
joint return. See Pub. 519 for details.

Married Filing Separately
Check  the  “Married  filing  separately” 
box at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR 
if  you  are  married,  at  the  end  of  2022, 
and  file  a  separate  return.  Enter  your 
spouse’s name in the entry space below 
the  filing  status  checkboxes.  Be  sure  to 
enter  your  spouse’s  SSN  or  Individual 
Taxpayer  Identification  Number  (ITIN) 
in  the  space  for  spouse’s  SSN  on  Form 
1040 or 1040-SR. If your spouse doesn’t

If you are married and file a separate 
return,  you  generally  report  only  your 
own  income,  deductions,  and  credits. 
Generally,  you  are  responsible  only  for 
the  tax  on  your  own  income.  Different 
rules  apply  to  people  in  community 
property states; see Pub. 555.

However,  you  will  usually  pay  more 
tax  than  if  you  use  another  filing  status 
for which you qualify. Also, if you file a 
separate  return,  you  can't  take  the  stu-
dent  loan  interest  deduction  or  the  edu-
cation credits, and you will only be able 
to  take  the  earned  income  credit  and 
child  and  dependent  care  credit  in  very 
limited  circumstances.  You  also  can't 
take  the  standard  deduction  if  your 
spouse itemizes deductions.

You may be able to file as head 
of household if you had a child 
living  with  you  and  you  lived 
apart from your spouse during the last 6 
months  of  2022.  See  Married  persons 
who live apart, later.

Head of Household
You can check the “Head of household” 
box at the top of Form 1040 or 1040-SR 
if you are unmarried and provide a home 
for  certain  other  persons.  You  are  con-
sidered unmarried for this purpose if any 
of the following applies.

• You were legally separated accord-
ing  to  your  state  law  under  a  decree  of 
divorce  or  separate  maintenance  at  the 
end of 2022. But if, at the end of 2022, 
your divorce wasn't final (an interlocuto-
ry decree), you are considered married.

• You  are  married  but  lived  apart 
from  your  spouse  for  the  last  6  months 
of 2022 and you meet the other rules un-
der Married persons who live apart, lat-
er.

• You  are  married  and  your  spouse 
was a nonresident alien at any time dur-
ing the year and the election to treat the 
alien  spouse  as  a  resident  alien  is  not 
made.
Check the “Head of household” box on-
ly  if  you  are  unmarried  (or  considered 
unmarried)  and  either  Test  1  or  Test  2 
applies.
Test  1.  You  paid  over  half  the  cost  of 
keeping  up  a  home  that  was  the  main 
home  for  all  of  2022  of  your  parent 

whom you can claim as a dependent, ex-
cept under a multiple support agreement 
(see  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  Dependent, 
later).  Your  parent  didn't  have  to  live 
with you.
Test  2.  You  paid  over  half  the  cost  of 
keeping  up  a  home  in  which  you  lived 
and  in  which  one  of  the  following  also 
lived  for  more  than  half  of  the  year  (if 
half  or  less,  see  Exception  to  time  lived 
with you, later).

1. Any person whom you can claim 

as a dependent. But don’t include:

a. Your  child  whom  you  claim  as 
your  dependent  because  of  the  rule  for 
Children  of  divorced  or  separated  pa-
rents  under  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  De-
pendent, later;

b. Any  person  who  is  your  depend-
ent  only  because  the  person  lived  with 
you for all of 2022; or

c. Any person you claimed as a de-
pendent under a multiple support agree-
ment.  See  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  De-
pendent, later.

2. Your  unmarried  qualifying  child 

who isn't your dependent.

3. Your  married  qualifying  child 
who  isn't  your  dependent  only  because 
you  can  be  claimed  as  a  dependent  on 
someone else's 2022 return.

4. Your  qualifying  child  who,  even 
though you are the custodial parent, isn't 
your  dependent  because  of  the  rule  for 
Children  of  divorced  or  separated  pa-
rents  under  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  De-
pendent, later.

If  the  child  isn't  claimed  as  your  de-
pendent, enter the child's name in the en-
try  space  below  the  filing  status  check-
boxes.  If  you  don’t  enter  the  name,  it 
will  take  us  longer  to  process  your  re-
turn.

The  dependents  you  claim  are 
those you list by name and SSN 
in  the  Dependents  section  on 

Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Exception  to  time  lived  with  you. 
Temporary absences by you or the other 
person  for  special  circumstances,  such 
as  school,  vacation,  business,  medical 
care,  military  service,  or  detention  in  a 
juvenile  facility,  count  as  time  lived  in 
the home. Also see Kidnapped child, lat-
er,  under  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  De-
pendent, if applicable.

If the person for whom you kept up a 
home was born or died in 2022, you still 
may be able to file as head of household. 
If the person is your qualifying child, the 
child must have lived with you for more 
than  half  the  part  of  the  year  the  child 
was  alive.  If  the  person  is  anyone  else, 
see  Pub.  501.  Similarly,  if  you  adopted 
the  person  for  whom  you  kept  up  a 
home  in  2022,  the  person  was  lawfully 
placed  with  you  for  legal  adoption  by 
you in 2022, or the person was an eligi-
ble  foster  child  placed  with  you  during 
2022,  the  person  is  considered  to  have 
lived  with  you  for  more  than  half  of 
2022  if  your  main  home  was  this  per-
son’s main home for more than half the 
time  since  the  person  was  adopted  or 
placed with you in 2022.
Keeping  up  a  home.  To  find  out  what 
is  included  in  the  cost  of  keeping  up  a 
home, see Pub. 501.

Married persons who live apart.  Even 
if you weren’t divorced or legally sepa-
rated at the end of 2022, you are consid-
ered  unmarried  if  all  of  the  following 
apply.

• You  lived  apart  from  your  spouse 
for the last 6 months of 2022. Tempora-
ry  absences  for  special  circumstances, 
such  as  for  business,  medical  care, 
school, or military service, count as time 
lived in the home.

• You  file  a  separate  return  from 

your spouse.

• You  paid  over  half  the  cost  of 

keeping up your home for 2022.

• Your home was the main home of 
your  child,  stepchild,  or  foster  child  for 
more  than  half  of  2022  (if  half  or  less, 
see  Exception  to  time  lived  with  you, 
earlier).

• You  can  claim  this  child  as  your 
dependent  or  could  claim  the  child  ex-
cept  that  the  child's  other  parent  can 
claim  the  child  under  the  rule  for  Chil-
dren  of  divorced  or  separated  parents

ent, later.

or 1040-SR and use joint return tax rates 
for 2022 if all of the following apply.

1. Your spouse died in 2020 or 2021 
and you didn't remarry before the end of 
2022.

2. You have a child or stepchild (not 
a foster child) whom you can claim as a 
dependent or could claim as a dependent 
except that, for 2022:

a. The  child  had  gross  income  of 

$4,400 or more,

b. The child filed a joint return, or
c. You  could  be  claimed  as  a  de-

pendent on someone else’s return.

If the child isn’t claimed as your de-
pendent,  enter  the  child’s  name  in  the 
entry  space  below  the  filing  status 
checkboxes. If you don’t enter the name, 
it will take us longer to process your re-
turn.

3. This child lived in your home for 
all  of  2022.  If  the  child  didn't  live  with 
you for the required time, see Exception 
to time lived with you, later.

4. You  paid  over  half  the  cost  of 

keeping up your home.

5. You  could  have  filed  a  joint  re-
turn  with  your  spouse  the  year  your 
spouse  died,  even  if  you  didn't  actually 
do so.

If your spouse died in 2022, you can't 
file  as  qualifying  surviving  spouse.  In-
stead,  see  the  instructions  for  Married 
Filing Jointly, earlier.
Adopted  child.  An  adopted  child  is  al-
ways  treated  as  your  own  child.  An 
adopted  child  includes  a  child  lawfully 
placed with you for legal adoption.
Dependent.  To  find  out  if  someone  is 
your  dependent,  see  Who  Qualifies  as 
Your Dependent, later.

The  dependents  you  claim  are 
those you list by name and SSN 
in  the  Dependents  section  on 

Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

Exception  to  time  lived  with  you. 
Temporary absences by you or the child 
for  special  circumstances,  such  as 
school, vacation, business, medical care, 
military  service,  or  detention  in  a  juve-
nile  facility,  count  as  time  lived  in  the 
home.  Also  see  Kidnapped  child,  later, 
under  Who  Qualifies  as  Your  Depend-
ent, if applicable.

A  child  is  considered  to  have  lived 
with you for all of 2022 if the child was 
born or died in 2022 and your home was 
the  child's  home  for  the  entire  time  the 
child  was  alive.  Similarly,  if  you  adop-
ted  the  child  in  2022,  or  the  child  was 
lawfully placed with you for legal adop-
tion by you in 2022, the child is consid-
ered  to  have  lived  with  you  for  all  of 
2022 if your main home was this child's 
main  home  for  the  entire  time  since  the 
child was adopted or placed with you in 
2022.
Keeping  up  a  home.  To  find  out  what 
is  included  in  the  cost  of  keeping  up  a 
home, see Pub. 501.

Name and Address
Print  or  type  the  information  in  the 
spaces  provided.  If  you  are  married  fil-
ing a separate return, enter your spouse's 
name in the entry space below the filing 
status checkboxes instead of below your 
name.

If  you  filed  a  joint  return  for 
2021 and you are filing a joint 
return  for  2022  with  the  same 
spouse, be sure to enter your names and 
SSNs in the same order as on your 2021 
return.

Name Change
If  you  changed  your  name  because  of 
marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report 
the  change  to  the  Social  Security  Ad-
ministration (SSA) before filing your re-
turn.  This  prevents  delays  in  processing 
your  return  and  issuing  refunds.  It  also 
safeguards  your  future  social  security 
benefits.

Address Change
If you plan to move after filing your re-
turn, use Form 8822 to notify the IRS of 
your new address.

P.O. Box
Enter your box number only if your post 
office doesn't deliver mail to your home.

Foreign Address
If  you  have  a  foreign  address,  enter  the 
city name on the appropriate line. Don’t 
enter any other information on that line, 
but also complete the spaces below that 
line. Don’t abbreviate the country name. 
Follow  the  country’s  practice  for  enter-
ing the postal code and the name of the 
province, county, or state.

Death of a Taxpayer
See Death of a Taxpayer under General 
Information, later.

Social Security 
Number (SSN)

An  incorrect  or  missing  SSN  can  in-
crease  your  tax,  reduce  your  refund,  or 
delay your refund. To apply for an SSN, 
fill  in  Form  SS-5  and  return  it,  along 
with  the  appropriate  evidence  docu-
ments,  to  the  Social  Security  Adminis-
tration  (SSA).  You  can  get  Form  SS-5 
online  at  SSA.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf,  from 
your local SSA office, or by calling the 
SSA  at  800-772-1213.  It  usually  takes 
about  2  weeks  to  get  an  SSN  once  the 
SSA  has  all  the  evidence  and  informa-
tion it needs.

Check  that  both  the  name  and  SSN 
on  your  Forms  1040  or  1040-SR,  W-2, 
and 1099 agree with your social security 
card.  If  they  don’t,  certain  deductions 
and  credits  on  Form  1040  or  1040-SR 
may  be  reduced  or  disallowed  and  you 
may  not  receive  credit  for  your  social 
security  earnings.  If  your  Form  W-2 
shows an incorrect SSN or name, notify 
your employer or the form-issuing agent 
as  soon  as  possible  to  make  sure  your 
earnings  are  credited  to  your  social  se-
curity  record.  If  the  name  or  SSN  on 
your  social  security  card  is  incorrect, 
call the SSA.

Once you are issued an SSN, use it to 
file your tax return. Use your SSN to file

not authorize employment or if you have 
been issued an SSN that authorizes em-
ployment  and  you  lose  your  employ-
ment authorization. An ITIN will not be 
issued to you once you have been issued 
an SSN. If you received your SSN after 
previously  using  an  ITIN,  stop  using 
your ITIN. Use your SSN instead.

IRS Individual Taxpayer 
Identification Numbers 
(ITINs) for Aliens
If you are a nonresident or resident alien 
and you don’t have and aren’t eligible to 
get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN. 
It takes about 7 weeks to get an ITIN.

If  you  already  have  an  ITIN,  enter  it 
wherever your SSN is requested on your 
tax return.

Some ITINs must be renewed. If you 
haven't used your ITIN on a federal tax 
return  at  least  once  for  tax  years  2019, 
2020,  or  2021,  it  expired  at  the  end  of 
2022  and  must  be  renewed  if  you  need 
to file a federal tax return in 2023. You 
don't  need  to  renew  your  ITIN  if  you 
don't  need  to  file  a  federal  tax  return. 
information  at 
You  can  find  more 
IRS.gov/ITIN.

ITINs  assigned  before  2013 
have  expired  and  must  be  re-
newed  if  you  need  to  file  a  tax 
return in 2023. If you previously submit-
ted a renewal application and it was ap-
proved, you do not need to renew again 
unless  you  haven't  used  your  ITIN  on  a 
federal  tax  return  at  least  once  for  tax 
years 2019, 2020, or 2021.

An ITIN is for tax use only. It doesn't 
entitle  you  to  social  security  benefits  or 
change  your  employment  or  immigra-
tion status under U.S. law.

For  more  information  on  ITINs,  in-
cluding  application,  expiration,  and  re-
newal,  see  Form  W-7  and  its  instruc-
tions.

If you receive an SSN after previous-
ly using an ITIN, stop using your ITIN. 
Use your SSN instead. Visit a local IRS 
office  or  write  a  letter  to  the  IRS  ex-
plaining that you now have an SSN and 
want  all  your  tax  records  combined  un-
der your SSN. Details about what to in-
clude with the letter and where to mail it 
are at IRS.gov/ITIN.

Nonresident Alien Spouse
If  your  spouse  is  a  nonresident  alien, 
your spouse must have either an SSN or 
an ITIN if:

• You file a joint return, or
• Your spouse is filing a separate re-

turn.

Presidential Election 
Campaign Fund
This  fund  helps  pay  for  Presidential 
election  campaigns.  The  fund  reduces 
candidates'  dependence  on  large  contri-
butions from individuals and groups and 
places  candidates  on  an  equal  financial 
footing in the general election. The fund 
also  helps  pay  for  pediatric  medical  re-
search. If you want $3 to go to this fund, 
check  the  box.  If  you  are  filing  a  joint 
return, your spouse can also have $3 go 
to the fund. If you check a box, your tax 
or refund won't change.

Digital Assets
Digital assets are any digital representa-
tions  of  value  that  are  recorded  on  a 
cryptographically  secured  distributed 
ledger  or  any  similar  technology.  For 
example,  digital  assets  include  non-fun-
gible  tokens  (NFTs)  and  virtual  curren-
cies,  such  as  cryptocurrencies  and  sta-
blecoins.  If  a  particular  asset  has  the 
characteristics  of  a  digital  asset,  it  will 
be  treated  as  a  digital  asset  for  federal 
income tax purposes.

Check  the  “Yes”  box  next  to  the 
question  on  digital  assets  on  page  1  of 
Form  1040  or  1040-SR  if  at  any  time 
during  2022,  you  (a)  received  (as  a  re-
ward, award, or payment for property or 
services); or (b) sold, exchanged, gifted, 
or  otherwise  disposed  of  a  digital  asset 
(or  any  financial  interest  in  any  digital 
asset).

For  example,  check  “Yes”  if  at  any 

time during 2022 you:

• Received digital assets as payment 

for property or services provided;

• Received  digital  assets  as  a  result 

of a reward or award;

• Received  new  digital  assets  as  a 
result of mining, staking, and similar ac-
tivities;

• Received  digital  assets  as  a  result 

of a hard fork;

• Disposed  of  digital  assets  in  ex-

change for property or services;

• Disposed  of  a  digital  asset  in  ex-
change or trade for another digital asset;

• Sold a digital asset;
• Transferred  digital  assets  for  free 
(without receiving any consideration) as 
a bona fide gift; or

• Otherwise disposed of any other fi-

nancial interest in a digital asset.

You have a financial interest in a dig-
ital asset if you are the owner of record 
of  a  digital  asset,  or  have  an  ownership 
stake  in  an  account  that  holds  one  or 
more  digital  assets,  including  the  rights 
and obligations to acquire a financial in-
terest,  or  you  own  a  wallet  that  holds 
digital assets.

The following actions or transactions 
in  2022,  alone,  generally  don’t  require 
you to check “Yes”:

• Holding  a  digital  asset  in  a  wallet 

or account;

• Transferring  a  digital  asset  from 
one  wallet  or  account  you  own  or  con-
trol to another wallet or account that you 
own or control; or

• Purchasing  digital  assets  using 
U.S.  or  other  real  currency,  including 
through  the  use  of  electronic  platforms 
such as PayPal and Venmo.

Do  not  leave  the  question  unan-
swered.  You  must  answer  “Yes”  or 
“No”  by  checking  the  appropriate  box. 
For  more  information,  go  to  IRS.gov/
virtualcurrencyfaqs.

How To Report Digital Asset 
Transactions

If,  in  2022,  you  disposed  of  any  digital 
asset, which you held as a capital asset, 
through  a  sale,  trade,  exchange,  pay-
ment, gift, or other transfer, check “Yes” 
and use (a) Form 8949 to calculate your 
capital  gain  or  loss  and  report  that  gain 
or  loss  on  Schedule  D  (Form  1040)  or 
(b) Form 709 in the case of gifts.

If  you  received  any  digital  asset  as 
compensation for services or disposed of 
any digital asset that you held for sale to 
customers  in  a  trade  or  business,  you 
must report the income as you would re-
port  other  income  of  the  same  type  (for 
example,  W-2  wages  on  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR,  line  1a,  or  inventory  or  serv-
ices on Schedule C).

Standard Deduction

If you are filing Form 1040-SR, 
you  can  find  a  Standard  De-
duction  Chart  on  the  last  page 
of  that  form  that  can  calculate  the 
amount  of  your  standard  deduction  in 
most situations.

Don’t  file  the  Standard  Deduction 

Chart with your return.

Single and Married Filing 
Jointly
If you or your spouse (if you are married 
and filing a joint return) can be claimed 
as a dependent on someone else’s return, 
check  the  appropriate  box  in  the  Stand-
ard Deduction section.

If you were a dual-status alien, check 
the  “Spouse  itemizes  on  a  separate  re-
turn  or  you  were  a  dual-status  alien” 
box. If you were a dual-status alien and 
you  file  a  joint  return  with  your  spouse 
who was a U.S. citizen or resident alien 
at  the  end  of  2022  and  you  and  your 
spouse  agree  to  be  taxed  on  your  com-
bined  worldwide  income,  don’t  check 
the box.

Age/Blindness

If you or your spouse (if you are married 
and  filing  a  joint  return)  were  born  be-
fore  January  2,  1958,  or  were  blind  at 
the  end  of  2022,  check  the  appropriate 

boxes  on  the  line  labeled  “Age/Blind-
ness.”

Don’t  check  any  boxes  for  your 
spouse  if  your  filing  status  is  head  of 
household.
Death  of  spouse 
in  2022.  If  your 
spouse was born before January 2, 1958, 
but died in 2022 before reaching age 65, 
don’t  check  the  box  that  says  “Spouse 
was born before January 2, 1958.”

A  person  is  considered  to  reach  age 
65  on  the  day  before  the  person’s  65th 
birthday.

Example.  Your  spouse  was  born  on 
February 14, 1957, and died on February 
13, 2022. Your spouse is considered age 
65 at the time of death. Check the appro-
priate  box  for  your  spouse.  However,  if 
your spouse died on February 12, 2022, 
your  spouse  isn't  considered  age  65. 
Don’t check the box.
Death  of  taxpayer  in  2022.  If  you  are 
preparing a return for someone who died 
in 2022, see Pub. 501 before completing 
the standard deduction information.

Blindness
If  you  weren’t  totally  blind  as  of  De-
cember  31,  2022,  you  must  get  a  state-
ment  certified  by  your  eye  doctor  (oph-
thalmologist or optometrist) that:

• You can't see better than 20/200 in 
your  better  eye  with  glasses  or  contact 
lenses, or

• Your  field  of  vision  is  20  degrees 

or less.

If  your  eye  condition  isn't  likely  to 
improve  beyond  the  conditions  listed 
above, you can get a statement certified 
by  your  eye  doctor  (ophthalmologist  or 
optometrist) to this effect instead.

You must keep the statement for your 

records.

If  you  receive  a  notice  or  letter  but 
you would prefer to have it in Braille or 
large print, you can use Form 9000, Al-
ternative  Media  Preference,  to  request 
notices  in  an  alternative  format  includ-
ing  Braille,  large  print,  audio,  or  elec-
tronic.  You  can  attach  Form  9000  to 
your return or mail it separately.

• You can download, or view online, 
tax  forms  and  publications  in  a  variety 
of  formats  including  text-only,  Braille 
ready  files,  browser-friendly  HTML 
(other  than  tax  forms),  accessible  PDF, 
and large print.

Married Filing Separately
If your filing status is married filing sep-
arately and your spouse itemizes deduc-
tions on their return, check the “Spouse 
itemizes  on  a  separate  return  or  you 
were a dual-status alien” box.

If  your  filing  status  is  married  filing 
separately and your spouse was born be-
fore January 2, 1958, or was blind at the 
end  of  2022,  you  can  check  the  appro-
priate  box(es)  on  the  line  labeled  “Age/
Blindness”  if  your  spouse  had  no  in-
come,  isn't  filing  a  return,  and  can't  be 
claimed  as  a  dependent  on  another  per-
son's return.

Who Qualifies as Your 
Dependent
Dependents, Qualifying Child for Child Tax 
Credit, and Credit for Other Dependents
Follow the steps below to find out if a person qualifies as your 
dependent  and  to  find  out  if  your  dependent  qualifies  you  to 
take  the  child  tax  credit  or  the  credit  for  other  dependents.  If 
you have more than four dependents, check the box under De-
pendents  on  page  1  of  Form  1040  or  1040-SR  and  include  a 
statement  showing  the  information  required  in  columns  (1) 
through (4).

The  dependents  you  claim  are  those  you  list  by  name 
and  SSN  in  the  Dependents  section  on  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR.

Before  you  begin.  See  the  definition  of  Social  security  num-
ber, later. If you want to claim the child tax credit or the credit 
for  other  dependents,  you  (and  your  spouse  if  filing  jointly) 
must have an SSN or ITIN issued on or before the due date of 
your  2022  return  (including  extensions).  If  an  ITIN  is  applied 
for on or before the due date of a 2022 return (including exten-
sions)  and  the  IRS  issues  an  ITIN  as  result  of  the  application, 
the  IRS  will  consider  the  ITIN  as  issued  on  or  before  the  due 
date of the return.

(or your spouse if filing jointly)

or

Under age 24 at the end of 2022, a student (defined later), and younger than you 
(or your spouse if filing jointly)

or
Any age and permanently and totally disabled (defined later)

Who didn't provide over half of their own support for 2022 (see Pub. 501)

Who isn't filing a joint return for 2022 
or is filing a joint return for 2022 only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or 
estimated tax paid (see Pub. 501 for details and examples)

Who lived with you for more than half of 2022. If the child didn't live with you 
for the required time, see Exception to time lived with you, later.

If the child meets the conditions to be a qualifying child of any 
other person (other than your spouse if filing jointly) for 2022, see 
Qualifying child of more than one person, later.

3. Was your qualifying relative married?

Yes. See Married 
person, later.

No.  Continue

4. Could you, or your spouse if filing jointly, be claimed as a 

dependent on someone else's 2022 tax return? (If the person 
who could claim you on their 2022 tax return is not required 
to file, and isn't filing a 2022 tax return or is filing a 2022 
return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or 
estimated tax paid, check “No.”) See Steps 1, 2, and 4.

Yes.

You can't claim any 
dependents. Complete 
the rest of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR and any 
applicable schedules.

No. You can claim this 
person as a dependent. 
Complete columns (1) 
through (3) of the 
Dependents section on

1040-SR. Then, go to 
Step 5.

Any other person (other than your spouse) who lived with you all year as a 
member of your household if your relationship didn't violate local law. If the 
person didn't live with you for the required time, see Exception to time lived with 
you, later.

Step 5

Does Your Qualifying Relative 
Qualify You for the Credit for 
Other Dependents?

Who wasn't a qualifying child (see Step 1) of any taxpayer for 2022. For this 
purpose, a person isn't a taxpayer if the person isn't required to file a U.S. income 
tax return and either doesn't file such a return or files only to get a refund of 
withheld income tax or estimated tax paid. See Pub. 501 for details and examples.

1. Did your qualifying relative have an SSN, ITIN, or ATIN 
issued on or before the due date of your 2022 return 
(including extensions)? (Answer “Yes” if you are applying 
for an ITIN or ATIN for the qualifying relative on or before 
the return due date (including extensions).)

Yes.  Continue

No.

Who had gross income of less than $4,400 in 2022. If the person was permanently 
and totally disabled, see Exception to gross income test, later.

Children of divorced or separated parents, Multiple support agreements, and 
Kidnapped child, later.

1. Does any person meet the conditions to be your qualifying 

relative?

Yes.  Continue

No.

You can’t claim the 
credit for other 
dependents for this 
qualifying relative.

2. Was your qualifying relative a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or 
U.S. resident alien? (See Pub. 519 for the definition of a 
U.S. national or a U.S. resident alien. If your qualifying 
relative was adopted, see Exception to citizenship test, 
later.)

dependents for this 
dependent. Check the 
“Credit for other 
dependents” box in 
column (4) of the 
Dependents section on 
page 1 of Form 1040 or 
1040-SR for this 
person.

2. Was your qualifying relative a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, 

U.S. resident alien, or a resident of Canada or Mexico? (See 
Pub. 519 for the definition of a U.S. national or U.S. 
resident alien. If your qualifying relative was adopted, see 
Exception to citizen test, later.)

Yes.  Continue

No.

You can't claim this 
person as a dependent.

Definitions and Special Rules
Adopted child.  An adopted child is always treated as your own 
child.  An  adopted  child  includes  a  child  lawfully  placed  with 
you for legal adoption.

Adoption  taxpayer  identification  numbers  (ATINs).  If  you 
have  a  dependent  who  was  placed  with  you  for  legal  adoption 
and  you  don’t  know  the  dependent’s  SSN,  you  must  get  an 
ATIN  for  the  dependent  from  the  IRS.  See  Form  W-7A  for

details. If the dependent isn't a U.S. citizen or resident alien, ap-
ply for an ITIN instead using Form W-7.

Children  of  divorced  or  separated  parents.  A  child  will  be 
treated  as  the  qualifying  child  or  qualifying  relative  of  the 
child’s noncustodial parent (defined later) if all of the following 
conditions apply.

1. The parents are divorced, legally separated, separated un-
der  a  written  separation  agreement,  or  lived  apart  at  all  times 
during  the  last  6  months  of  2022  (whether  or  not  they  are  or 
were married).

2. The  child  received  over  half  of  the  child’s  support  for 
2022 from the parents (and the rules on Multiple support agree-
ments, later, don’t apply). Support of a child received from a pa-
rent's spouse is treated as provided by the parent.

3. The child is in custody of one or both of the parents for 

more than half of 2022.

4. Either of the following applies.
a. The  custodial  parent  signs  Form  8332  or  a  substantially 
similar statement that they won't claim the child as a dependent 
for  2022,  and  the  noncustodial  parent  includes  a  copy  of  the 
form or statement with their return. If the divorce decree or sep-
aration agreement went into effect after 1984 and before 2009, 
the  noncustodial  parent  may  be  able  to  include  certain  pages 
from  the  decree  or  agreement  instead  of  Form  8332.  See 
Post-1984  and  pre-2009  decree  or  agreement  and  Post-2008 
decree or agreement.

b. A pre-1985 decree of divorce or separate maintenance or 
written separation agreement between the parents provides that 
the noncustodial parent can claim the child as a dependent, and 
the noncustodial parent provides at least $600 for support of the 
child during 2022.

If conditions (1) through (4) apply, only the noncustodial pa-
rent can claim the child for purposes of the child tax credits and 
credit  for  other  dependents  (lines  19  and  28).  However,  this 
doesn't  allow  the  noncustodial  parent  to  claim  head  of  house-
hold filing status, the credit for child and dependent care expen-
ses, the exclusion for dependent care benefits, or the earned in-
come  credit.  The  custodial  parent  or  another  taxpayer,  if  eligi-
ble, can claim the child for the earned income credit and these 
other benefits. See Pub. 501 for details.

Custodial and noncustodial parents.  The custodial parent is 
the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of 
nights  in  2022.  The  noncustodial  parent  is  the  other  parent.  If 
the  child  was  with  each  parent  for  an  equal  number  of  nights, 
the custodial parent is the parent with the higher adjusted gross 
income. See Pub. 501 for an exception for a parent who works 
at  night,  rules  for  a  child  who  is  emancipated  under  state  law, 
and other details.

Post-1984  and  pre-2009  decree  or  agreement.  The  decree 

or agreement must state all three of the following.

1. The noncustodial parent can claim the child as a depend-
ent without regard to any condition, such as payment of support.
2. The other parent won't claim the child as a dependent.
3. The years for which the claim is released.

The noncustodial parent must include all of the following pa-

ges from the decree or agreement.

• Cover page (include the other parent's SSN on that page).
• The pages that include all the information identified in (1) 

• Signature  page  with  the  other  parent's  signature  and  date 

through (3) above.

of agreement.

You must include the required information even if you 
filed it with your return in an earlier year.

Post-2008  decree  or  agreement.  If  the  divorce  decree  or 
separation agreement went into effect after 2008, the noncusto-
dial parent can't include pages from the decree or agreement in-
stead of Form 8332. The custodial parent must sign either Form 
8332  or  a  substantially  similar  statement  the  only  purpose  of 
which  is  to  release  the  custodial  parent's  claim  to  certain  tax 
benefits for a child, and the noncustodial parent must include a 
copy with their return. The form or statement must release the 
custodial parent's claim to the child without any conditions. For 
example,  the  release  must  not  depend  on  the  noncustodial  pa-
rent paying support.

Release of certain tax benefits revoked.  A custodial parent 
who has revoked their previous release of a claim to certain tax 
benefits for a child must include a copy of the revocation with 
their return. For details, see Form 8332.

Exception to citizen test.  If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. na-
tional and your adopted child lived with you all year as a mem-
ber of your household, that child meets the requirement to be a 
U.S.  citizen  in  Step  2,  question  1;  Step  3,  question  2;  Step  4, 
question 2; and Step 5, question 2.
Exception  to  gross  income  test.  If  your  relative  (including  a 
person who lived with you all year as a member of your house-
hold) is permanently and totally disabled (defined later), certain 
income for services performed at a sheltered workshop may be 
excluded for this test. For details, see Pub. 501.
Exception to time lived with you.  Temporary absences by you 
or  the  other  person  for  special  circumstances,  such  as  school, 
vacation,  business,  medical  care,  military  service,  or  detention 
in  a  juvenile  facility,  count  as  time  the  person  lived  with  you. 
Also see Children of divorced or separated parents, earlier, or 
Kidnapped child, later.

If the person meets all other requirements to be your qualify-
ing child but was born or died in 2022, the person is considered 
to have lived with you for more than half of 2022 if your home 
was  this  person's  home  for  more  than  half  the  time  the  person 
was alive in 2022. If the person meets all other requirements to 
be your qualifying child but you adopted the person in 2022, the 
person was lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you 
in  2022,  or  the  person  was  an  eligible  foster  child  placed  with 
you  during  2022,  the  person  is  considered  to  have  lived  with 
you for more than half of 2022 if your main home was this per-
son's  main  home  for  more  than  half  the  time  since  the  person 
was adopted or placed with you in 2022.

Any other person is considered to have lived with you for all 
of 2022 if the person was born or died in 2022 and your home 
was this person's home for the entire time the person was alive

in  2022  or  if  you  adopted  the  person  in  2022,  the  person  was 
lawfully placed with you for legal adoption by you in 2022, or 
the  person  was  an  eligible  foster  child  placed  with  you  during 
2022 and your main home was the person's main home for the 
entire time since the person was adopted or placed with you in 
2022.

Foster child.  A foster child is any child placed with you by an 
authorized  placement  agency  or  by  judgment,  decree,  or  other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction.

Kidnapped  child.  If  your  child  is  presumed  by  law  enforce-
ment authorities to have been kidnapped by someone who isn't a 
family member, you may be able to take the child into account 
in determining your eligibility for head of household or qualify-
ing surviving spouse filing status, the child tax credit, the credit 
for  other  dependents,  and  the  earned  income  credit  (EIC).  For 
details, see Pub. 501 (Pub. 596 for the EIC).

Married  person.  If  the  person  is  married  and  files  a  joint  re-
turn, you can't claim that person as your dependent. However, if 
the  person  is  married  but  doesn't  file  a  joint  return  or  files  a 
joint return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or es-
timated tax paid, you may be able to claim that person as a de-
pendent. (See Pub. 501 for details and examples.) In that case, 
go to Step 2, question 3 (for a qualifying child), or Step 4, ques-
tion 4 (for a qualifying relative).

Multiple  support  agreements.  If  no  one  person  contributed 
over half of the support of your relative (or a person who lived 
with you all year as a member of your household) but you and 
another  person(s)  provided  more  than  half  of  your  relative's 
support, special rules may apply that would treat you as having 
provided over half of the support. For details, see Pub. 501.

Permanently  and  totally  disabled.  A  person  is  permanently 
and totally disabled if, at any time in 2022, the person can't en-
gage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or 
mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condition 
has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at least a 
year or can be expected to lead to death.
Public  assistance  payments.  If  you  received  payments  under 
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program 
or  other  public  assistance  program  and  you  used  the  money  to 
support another person, see Pub. 501.

Qualifying  child  of  more  than  one  person.  Even  if  a  child 
meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one 
person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child 
for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for 
Children  of  divorced  or  separated  parents,  described  earlier, 
applies.

1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (line 19) 

and additional child tax credit (line 28).
2. Head of household filing status.
3. Credit  for  child  and  dependent  care  expenses  (Schedule 

3, line 2).

4. Exclusion  for  dependent  care  benefits  (Form  2441,  Part 

III).

5. Earned income credit (line 27).

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed 
based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can 
claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. 
For purposes of these rules, the term "parent" means a biologi-
cal or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a step-
parent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the indi-
vidual.

• If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is 

treated as the qualifying child of the parent.

• If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the 
child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the parents.

• If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa-
rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the 
child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child 
lived  for  the  longer  period  of  time  in  2022.  If  the  child  lived 
with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat 
the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-
er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022.

• If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the 
child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the 
highest AGI for 2022.

• If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no 
parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-
ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but 
only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any 
parent of the child who can claim the child.

Example.  Your child, J, meets the conditions to be a quali-
fying child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the con-
ditions  to  be  a  qualifying  child  of  any  other  person,  including 
J’s other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J 
as a qualifying child for all of the five tax benefits just listed for 
which  you  otherwise  qualify.  Your  parent  can't  claim  any  of 
those  five  tax  benefits  based  on  J.  However,  if  your  parent’s 
AGI is higher than yours and you do not claim J as a qualifying 
child, J is the qualifying child of your parent.

For more details and examples, see Pub. 501.
If you will be claiming the child as a qualifying child, go to 
Step  2.  Otherwise,  stop;  you  can't  claim  any  benefits  based  on 
this child.

Social security number.  You must enter each dependent's so-
cial security number (SSN). Be sure the name and SSN entered 
agree  with  the  dependent's  social  security  card.  Otherwise,  at 
the time we process your return, we may reduce or disallow any 
tax benefits (such as the child tax credit) based on that depend-
ent. If the name or SSN on the dependent's social security card 
isn't correct or you need to get an SSN for your dependent, con-
tact  the  Social  Security  Administration  (SSA).  See  Social  Se-
curity  Number  (SSN),  earlier.  If  your  dependent  won't  have  a 
number  by  the  date  your  return  is  due,  see  What  if  You  Can't 
File on Time? earlier.

For  the  child  tax  credit,  your  child  must  have  the  required 
SSN. The required SSN is one that is valid for employment and 
that is issued by the SSA before the due date of your 2022 re-
turn  (including  extensions).  If  your  child  was  a  U.S.  citizen 
when the child received the SSN, the SSN is valid for employ-
ment. If “Not Valid for Employment” is printed on your child’s

social  security  card  and  your  child’s  immigration  status  has 
changed  so  that  your  child  is  now  a  U.S.  citizen  or  permanent 
resident, ask the SSA for a new social security card without the 
legend. However, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authori-
zation” is printed on your child’s social security card, your child 
has the required SSN only as long as the DHS authorization is 
valid.

If your dependent child was born and died in 2022 and you 
do not have an SSN for the child, enter “Died” in column (2) of 
the  Dependents  section  and  include  a  copy  of  the  child's  birth 
certificate, death certificate, or hospital records. The document 
must show the child was born alive.

If you, or your spouse if filing jointly, didn't have an SSN (or 
ITIN) issued on or before the due date of your 2022 return (in-

cluding  extensions),  you  can't  claim  the  child  tax  credit  or  the 
credit  for  other  dependents  on  your  original  or  an  amended 
2022 return.

If  you  apply  for  an  ITIN  on  or  before  the  due  date  of  your 
2022  return  (including  extensions)  and  the  IRS  issues  you  an 
ITIN  as  a  result  of  the  application,  the  IRS  will  consider  your 
ITIN as issued on or before the due date of your return.
Student.  A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar 
months of 2022 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school 
or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or 
a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a 
technical,  trade,  or  mechanical  school.  It  doesn't  include  an 
on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of-
fering courses only through the Internet.

Income
Generally,  you  must  report  all  income 
except  income  that  is  exempt  from  tax 
by law. For details, see the following in-
structions  and  the  Schedule  1  instruc-
tions, especially the instructions for lines 
1  through  7  and  Schedule  1,  lines  1 
through 8z. Also see Pub. 525.

Forgiveness of Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) 
Loans
The  forgiveness  of  a  PPP  Loan  creates 
tax-exempt  income,  so  although  you 
don’t need to report the income from the 
forgiveness  of  your  PPP  Loan  on  Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, you do need to report 
certain  information  related  to  your  PPP 
Loan.

Rev.  Proc.  2021-48,  2021-49  I.R.B. 
835,  permits  taxpayers  to  treat  tax-ex-
empt income resulting from the forgive-
ness  of  a  PPP  Loan  as  received  or  ac-
crued: (1) as, and to the extent that, eli-
gible  expenses  are  paid  or  incurred;  (2) 
when  you  apply  for  forgiveness  of  the 
PPP  Loan;  or  (3)  when  forgiveness  of 
the  PPP  Loan  is  granted.  If  you  have 
tax-exempt  income  resulting  from  the 
forgiveness  of  a  PPP  Loan,  attach  a 
statement  to  your  return  reporting  each 
taxable year for which you are applying 
Rev.  Proc.  2021-48,  and  which  section 
of  Rev.  Proc.  2021-48  you  are  apply-
ing—either  section  3.01(1),  (2),  or  (3). 
Any  statement  should  include  the  fol-
lowing information for each PPP Loan:

1. Your name, address, and ITIN or 

SSN;

2. A statement that you are applying 
or applied section 3.01(1), (2), or (3) of 
Rev.  Proc.  2021-48,  and  for  what  taxa-
ble year;

3. The  amount  of  tax-exempt  in-
come from forgiveness of the PPP Loan 
that  you  are  treating  as  received  or  ac-
crued and for what taxable year; and

4. Whether  forgiveness  of  the  PPP 
Loan has been granted as of the date you 
file your return.

Write “RP2021-48” at the top of your 

attached statement.

Foreign-Source Income
You must report unearned income, such 
as  interest,  dividends,  and  pensions, 
from  sources  outside  the  United  States 
unless  exempt  by  law  or  a  tax  treaty. 
You  must  also  report  earned  income, 
such  as  wages  and  tips,  from  sources 
outside the United States.

If  you  worked  abroad,  you  may  be 
able  to  exclude  part  or  all  of  your  for-
eign  earned  income.  For  details,  see 
Pub. 54 and Form 2555.
Foreign retirement plans.  If you were 
a  beneficiary  of  a  foreign  retirement 
plan, you may have to report the undis-
tributed  income  earned  in  your  plan. 
However, if you were the beneficiary of 
a  Canadian  registered  retirement  plan, 
see  Rev.  Proc.  2014-55,  2014-44  I.R.B. 
IRS.gov/irb/

you  can  elect  to  defer  tax  on  the  undis-
tributed income.

Foreign  accounts  and

must complete Part III of Schedule B if 
you:

• Had a foreign account; or
• Received  a  distribution  from,  or 
were  a  grantor  of,  or  a  transferor  to,  a 
foreign trust.
Foreign  financial  assets.  If  you  had 
foreign  financial  assets  in  2022,  you 
may  have  to  file  Form  8938.  See  Form 
8938 and its instructions.

Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 
Cases
If you are a debtor in a chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy case, income taxable to the bank-
ruptcy estate and reported on the estate's 
income tax return includes:

• Earnings  from  services  you  per-
formed  after  the  beginning  of  the  case 
(both  wages  and  self-employment  in-
come); and

• Income from property described in 
section 541 of title 11 of the U.S. Code 
that you either owned when the case be-
gan  or  that  you  acquired  after  the  case 
began  and  before  the  case  was  closed, 
dismissed, or converted to a case under a 
different chapter.

Because this income is taxable to the 
estate, don’t include this income on your 

own  individual  income  tax  return.  The 
only  exception  is  for  purposes  of  figur-
ing  your  self-employment  tax.  For  that 
purpose,  you  must  take  into  account  all 
your  self-employment  income  for  the 
year  from  services  performed  both  be-
fore and after the beginning of the case. 
Also,  you  (or  the  trustee  if  one  is  ap-
pointed) must allocate between you and 
the  bankruptcy  estate  the  wages,  salary, 
or  other  compensation  and  withheld  in-
come tax reported to you on Form W-2. 
A  similar  allocation  is  required  for  in-
come  and  withheld  income  tax  reported 
to  you  on  Forms  1099.  You  must  also 
include  a  statement  that  indicates  you 
filed a chapter 11 case and that explains 
how income and withheld income tax re-
ported  to  you  on  Forms  W-2  and  1099 
are allocated between you and the estate.

individual  and  their  domestic  partner. 
See Form 8958 and Pub. 555.

Rounding Off to Whole 
Dollars
You can round off cents to whole dollars 
on your return and schedules. If you do 
round to whole dollars, you must round 
all amounts. To round, drop amounts un-
der 50 cents and increase amounts from 
50 to 99 cents to the next dollar. For ex-
ample, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 be-
comes $3.

If  you  have  to  add  two  or  more 
amounts to figure the amount to enter on 
a  line,  include  cents  when  adding  the 
amounts and round off only the total.

your spouse if filing jointly) deferred for 
2022  under  all  plans  was  more  than 
$20,500  (excluding  catch-up  contribu-
tions as explained later), include the ex-

(including any tax-exempt original issue 
discount (OID)), such as from municipal 
bonds,  each  payer  should  send  you  a 
Form 1099-INT or a Form 1099-OID. In 
general,  your  tax-exempt  stated  interest 
should  be  shown  in  box  8  of  Form 
1099-INT  or,  for  a  tax-exempt  OID 
bond,  in  box  2  of  Form  1099-OID,  and 
your  tax-exempt  OID  should  be  shown 
in box 11 of Form 1099-OID. Enter the 
total  on  line  2a.  However,  if  you  ac-
quired a tax-exempt bond at a premium, 
only  report  the  net  amount  of  tax-ex-
empt interest on line 2a (that is, the ex-
cess  of  the  tax-exempt  interest  received 
during the year over the amortized bond 
premium  for  the  year).  Also,  if  you  ac-
quired a tax-exempt OID bond at an ac-
quisition  premium,  only  report  the  net 
amount  of  tax-exempt  OID  on  line  2a 
(that  is,  the  excess  of  tax-exempt  OID 
for  the  year  over  the  amortized  acquisi-
tion premium for the year). See Pub. 550 
for  more  information  about  OID,  bond 
premium, and acquisition premium.

Also  include  on  line  2a  any  ex-
empt-interest  dividends  from  a  mutual 
fund or other regulated investment com-
pany.  This  amount  should  be  shown  in 
box 12 of Form 1099-DIV.

Don’t include interest earned on your 
IRA,  health  savings  account,  Archer  or 
Medicare Advantage MSA, or Coverdell 
education savings account.

Don’t  include  any  amounts  re-
lated to the forgiveness of PPP 
Loans on this line.

Line 2b

Taxable Interest
Each  payer  should  send  you  a  Form 
1099-INT  or  Form  1099-OID.  Enter 
your  total  taxable  interest  income  on 
line  2b.  But  you  must  fill  in  and  attach 
Schedule B if the total is over $1,500 or 
any  of  the  other  conditions  listed  at  the 
beginning of the Schedule B instructions 
applies to you.

Interest  credited  in  2022  on  deposits 
that  you  couldn't  withdraw  because  of 
the  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  of  the  fi-
nancial  institution  may  not  have  to  be 
included  in  your  2022  income.  For  de-
tails, see Pub. 550.

Preferred  dividends  attributable  to  peri-

just described.

• Dividends on any share of stock to 
the  extent  that  you  are  under  an  obliga-
tion (including a short sale) to make re-
lated payments with respect to positions 
in substantially similar or related proper-
ty.

• Payments in lieu of dividends, but 
only  if  you  know  or  have  reason  to 
know  that  the  payments  aren't  qualified 
dividends.

• Dividends  from  a  corporation  that 
first became a surrogate foreign corpora-
tion after December 22, 2017, other than 
a foreign corporation that is treated as a 
domestic  corporation  under  section 
7874(b).

Example 1.  You bought 5,000 shares 
of XYZ Corp. common stock on July 8, 
2022.  XYZ  Corp.  paid  a  cash  dividend 
of  10  cents  per  share.  The  ex-dividend 
date  was  July  16,  2022.  Your  Form 
1099-DIV from XYZ Corp. shows $500 
in  box  1a  (ordinary  dividends)  and  in 
box  1b  (qualified  dividends).  However, 
you sold the 5,000 shares on August 11, 
2022.  You  held  your  shares  of  XYZ 
Corp.  for  only  34  days  of  the  121-day 
period  (from  July  9,  2022,  through  Au-
gust  11,  2022).  The  121-day  period  be-
gan  on  May  17,  2022  (60  days  before 
the  ex-dividend  date),  and  ended  on 
September 14, 2022. You have no quali-
fied dividends from XYZ Corp. because 

you held the XYZ stock for less than 61 
days.

Example 2.  The facts are the same as 
in Example 1 except that you bought the 
stock  on  July  15,  2022  (the  day  before 
the  ex-dividend  date),  and  you  sold  the 
stock on September 16, 2022. You held 
the  stock  for  63  days  (from  July  16, 
2022, through September 16, 2022). The 
$500  of  qualified  dividends  shown  in 
box 1b of Form 1099-DIV are all quali-
fied  dividends  because  you  held  the 
stock for 61 days of the 121-day period 
(from July 16, 2022, through September 
14, 2022).

Example  3.  You  bought  10,000 
shares  of  ABC  Mutual  Fund  common 
stock  on  July  8,  2022.  ABC  Mutual 
Fund paid a cash dividend of 10 cents a 
share. The ex-dividend date was July 16, 
2022.  The  ABC  Mutual  Fund  advises 
you that the part of the dividend eligible 
to  be  treated  as  qualified  dividends 
equals  2  cents  a  share.  Your  Form 
1099-DIV  from  ABC  Mutual  Fund 
shows total ordinary dividends of $1,000 
and  qualified  dividends  of  $200.  How-
ever, you sold the 10,000 shares on Au-
gust  11,  2022.  You  have  no  qualified 
dividends  from  ABC  Mutual  Fund  be-
cause  you  held  the  ABC  Mutual  Fund 
stock for less than 61 days.

Use  the  Qualified  Dividends 
and  Capital  Gain  Tax  Work-
sheet  or  the  Schedule  D  Tax 
Worksheet,  whichever  applies,  to  figure 
your tax. See the instructions for line 16 
for details.

Line 3b

Ordinary Dividends
Each  payer  should  send  you  a  Form 
1099-DIV. Enter your total ordinary div-
idends  on  line  3b.  This  amount  should 
in  box  1a  of  Form(s) 
be  shown 
1099-DIV.

You  must  fill  in  and  attach  Sched-
ule  B  if  the  total  is  over  $1,500  or  you 
received,  as  a  nominee,  ordinary  divi-
dends  that  actually  belong  to  someone 
else.

Nondividend Distributions

Some  distributions  are  a  return  of  your 
cost  (or  other  basis).  They  won't  be 

taxed  until  you  recover  your  cost  (or 
other basis). You must reduce your cost 
(or  other  basis)  by  these  distributions. 
After  you  get  back  all  of  your  cost  (or 
other  basis),  you  must  report  these  dis-
tributions as capital gains on Form 8949. 
For details, see Pub. 550.

Dividends  on  insurance  poli-
cies  are  a  partial  return  of  the 
premiums  you  paid.  Don’t  re-
port them as dividends. Include them in 
income  on  Schedule  1,  line  8z,  only  if 
they exceed the total of all net premiums 
you paid for the contract.

Lines 4a and 4b

IRA Distributions
You  should  receive  a  Form  1099-R 
showing  the  total  amount  of  any  distri-
bution from your IRA before income tax 
or other deductions were withheld. This 
amount  should  be  shown  in  box  1  of 
Form 1099-R. Unless otherwise noted in 
the  line  4a  and  4b  instructions,  an  IRA 
includes  a  traditional  IRA,  Roth  IRA, 
simplified  employee  pension 
(SEP) 
IRA, and a savings incentive match plan 
for  employees  (SIMPLE)  IRA.  Except 
as provided next, leave line 4a blank and 
enter  the  total  distribution  (from  Form 
1099-R, box 1) on line 4b.
Exception 1.  Enter the total distribution 
on line 4a if you rolled over part or all of 
the distribution from one:

• Roth IRA to another Roth IRA, or
• IRA  (other  than  a  Roth  IRA)  to  a 
qualified  plan  or  another  IRA  (other 
than a Roth IRA).

Also enter “Rollover” next to line 4b. 
If  the  total  distribution  was  rolled  over, 
enter -0- on line 4b. If the total distribu-
tion wasn't rolled over, enter the part not 
rolled over on line 4b unless Exception 2 
applies to the part not rolled over. Gen-
erally,  a  rollover  must  be  made  within 
60  days  after  the  day  you  received  the 
distribution.  For  more  details  on  roll-
overs, see Pub. 590-A and Pub. 590-B.

If you rolled over the distribution into 
a qualified plan or you made the rollover 
in  2023,  include  a  statement  explaining 
what you did.
Exception 2.  If any of the following ap-
ply, enter the total distribution on line 4a 
and  see  Form  8606  and  its  instructions 
to figure the amount to enter on line 4b.

them returned to you in 2022.

6. You recharacterized part or all of 
a contribution to a Roth IRA as a contri-
bution  to  another  type  of  IRA,  or  vice 
versa.

Exception 3.  If all or part of the distri-
bution  is  a  qualified  charitable  distribu-
tion  (QCD),  enter  the  total  distribution 
on line 4a. If the total amount distributed 
is  a  QCD,  enter  -0-  on  line  4b.  If  only 
part  of  the  distribution  is  a  QCD,  enter 
the part that is not a QCD on line 4b un-
less Exception 2 applies to that part. En-
ter “QCD” next to line 4b.

A QCD is a distribution made direct-
ly by the trustee of your IRA (other than 
an ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRA) to an 
organization  eligible  to  receive  tax-de-
ductible  contributions  (with  certain  ex-
ceptions).  You  must  have  been  at  least 
age  70  1/2  when  the  distribution  was 
made.

Generally,  your  total  QCDs  for  the 
year can't be more than $100,000. (On a 
joint return, your spouse can also have a 
QCD of up to $100,000.) The amount of 
the  QCD  is  limited  to  the  amount  that 

would otherwise be included in your in-
come. If your IRA includes nondeducti-
ble contributions, the distribution is first 
considered  to  be  paid  out  of  otherwise 
taxable  income.  See  Pub.  590-B  for  de-
tails.

You  can't  claim  a  charitable 
contribution  deduction  for  any 
QCD  not  included  in  your  in-

come.

Exception 4.  If all or part of the distri-
bution is a health savings account (HSA) 
funding distribution (HFD), enter the to-
tal  distribution  on  line  4a.  If  the  total 
amount  distributed  is  an  HFD  and  you 
elect to exclude it from income, enter -0- 
on  line  4b.  If  only  part  of  the  distribu-
tion is an HFD and you elect to exclude 
that part from income, enter the part that 
isn't an HFD on line 4b unless Exception 
2 applies to that part. Enter “HFD” next 
to line 4b.

An  HFD  is  a  distribution  made  di-
rectly  by  the  trustee  of  your  IRA  (other 
than  an  ongoing  SEP  or  SIMPLE  IRA) 
to your HSA. If eligible, you can gener-
ally elect to exclude an HFD from your 
income once in your lifetime. You can't 
exclude  more  than  the  limit  on  HSA 
contributions  or  more  than  the  amount 
that would otherwise be included in your 
income. If your IRA includes nondeduc-
tible contributions, the HFD is first con-
sidered to be paid out of otherwise taxa-
ble income. See Pub. 969 for details.

The amount of an HFD reduces 
the  amount  you  can  contribute 
to your HSA for the year. If you 
fail  to  maintain  eligibility  for  an  HSA 
for the 12 months following the month of 
the  HFD,  you  may  have  to  report  the 
HFD  as  income  and  pay  an  additional 
tax. See Form 8889, Part III.

More  than  one  exception  applies.  If 
more than one exception applies, include 
a statement showing the amount of each 
exception,  instead  of  making  an  entry 
next to line 4b. For example: “Line 4b – 
$1,000  Rollover  and  $500  HFD.”  But 
you do not need to attach a statement if 
only  Exception  2  and  one  other  excep-
tion apply.
More than one distribution.  If you (or 
your  spouse  if  filing  jointly)  received 
more  than  one  distribution,  figure  the 
taxable  amount  of  each  distribution  and 

enter the total of the taxable amounts on 
line  4b.  Enter  the  total  amount  of  those 
distributions on line 4a.

You  may  have  to  pay  an  addi-
tional  tax  if  you  received  an 
early  distribution  from  your 
IRA and the total wasn't rolled over. See 
the  instructions  for  Schedule  2,  line  8, 
for details.

More  information.  For  more  informa-
tion  about  IRAs,  see  Pub.  590-A  and 
Pub. 590-B.

Lines 5a and 5b

Pensions and Annuities
You  should  receive  a  Form  1099-R 
showing  the  total  amount  of  your  pen-
sion  and  annuity  payments  before  in-
come tax or other deductions were with-
held.  This  amount  should  be  shown  in 
box 1 of Form 1099-R. Pension and an-
nuity  payments 
include  distributions 
from  401(k),  403(b),  and  governmental 
457(b)  plans.  Rollovers  and  lump-sum 
distributions  are  explained  later.  Don’t 
include the following payments on lines 
5a  and  5b.  Instead,  report  them  on 
line 1h.

• Disability pensions received before 
you  reach  the  minimum  retirement  age 
set by your employer.

• Corrective  distributions  (including 
any  earnings)  of  excess  elective  defer-
rals  or  other  excess  contributions  to  re-
tirement  plans.  The  plan  must  advise 
you  of  the  year(s)  the  distributions  are 
includible in income.

Attach  Form(s)  1099-R 
to 
Form  1040  or  1040-SR  if  any 
federal  income  tax  was  with-

held.

Fully Taxable Pensions and 
Annuities

Your  payments  are  fully  taxable  if  (a) 
you  didn't  contribute  to  the  cost  (see 
Cost,  later)  of  your  pension  or  annuity, 
or (b) you got your entire cost back tax 
free before 2022. But see Insurance Pre-
miums  for  Retired  Public  Safety  Offi-
cers, later. If your pension or annuity is 
fully  taxable,  enter  the  total  pension  or 
annuity 
(from  Form(s) 
1099-R,  box  1)  on  line  5b;  don’t  make 
an entry on line 5a.

Partially Taxable Pensions and 
Annuities

Enter  the  total  pension  or  annuity  pay-
ments  (from  Form  1099-R,  box  1)  on 
line  5a.  If  your  Form  1099-R  doesn't 
show  the  taxable  amount,  you  must  use 
the  General  Rule  explained  in  Pub.  939 
to  figure  the  taxable  part  to  enter  on 
line 5b. But if your annuity starting date 
(defined  later)  was  after  July  1,  1986, 
see Simplified Method, later, to find out 
if you must use that method to figure the 
taxable part.

You can ask the IRS to figure the tax-
able  part  for  you  for  a  $1,000  fee.  For 
details, see Pub. 939.

If your Form 1099-R shows a taxable 
amount,  you  can  report  that  amount  on 
line 5b. But you may be able to report a 
lower taxable amount by using the Gen-
eral Rule or the Simplified Method or if 
the exclusion for retired public safety of-
ficers, discussed next, applies.

Insurance Premiums for Retired 
Public Safety Officers

If you are an eligible retired public safe-
ty officer (law enforcement officer, fire-
fighter, chaplain, or member of a rescue 
squad or ambulance crew), you can elect 
to  exclude  from  income  distributions 
made from your eligible retirement plan 
that  are  used  to  pay  the  premiums  for 
coverage  by  an  accident  or  health  plan 
or  a  long-term  care  insurance  contract. 
You  can  do  this  only  if  you  retired  be-
cause  of  disability  or  because  you 
reached normal retirement age. The pre-
miums can be for coverage for you, your 
spouse,  or  dependents.  The  distribution 
must  be  from  a  plan  maintained  by  the 
employer  from  which  you  retired  as  a 
public  safety  officer.  Also,  the  distribu-
tion must be made directly from the plan 
to the provider of the accident or health 
plan  or  long-term  care  insurance  con-
tract. You can exclude from income the 
smaller  of  the  amount  of  the  premiums 
or  $3,000.  You  can  make  this  election 

only  for  amounts  that  would  otherwise 
be included in your income.

An  eligible  retirement  plan  is  a  gov-
ernmental plan that is a qualified trust or 
a section 403(a), 403(b), or 457(b) plan.

If  you  make  this  election,  reduce  the 
otherwise  taxable  amount  of  your  pen-
sion or annuity by the amount excluded. 
The  amount  shown  in  box  2a  of  Form 
1099-R doesn't reflect the exclusion. Re-
port  your  total  distributions  on  line  5a 
and the taxable amount on line 5b. Enter 
“PSO” next to line 5b.

If you are retired on disability and re-
porting  your  disability  pension  on 
line 1h, include only the taxable amount 
on  that  line  and  enter  “PSO”  and  the 
amount excluded on the dotted line next 
to line 1h.
Payments  when  you  are  disabled.  If 
you receive payments from a retirement 
or profit-sharing plan that does not pro-
vide  for  disability  retirement,  do  not 
treat  those  payments  as  disability  pay-
ments.  The  payments  must  be  reported 
as a pension or annuity.

You must include in your income any 
amounts  that  you  received  that  you 
would  have  received  in  retirement  had 
you not become disabled as a result of a 
terrorist  attack.  Include  in  your  income 
any  payments  you  receive  from  a 
401(k), pension, or other retirement plan 
to  the  extent  that  you  would  have  re-
ceived  the  amount  at  the  same  or  later 
time  regardless  of  whether  you  had  be-
come disabled.

Example.  Taxpayer  J,  a  contractor, 
was disabled as a direct result of partici-
pating  in  efforts  to  clean  up  the  World 
Trade Center. J is eligible for compensa-
tion  by  the  September  11  Victim  Com-
pensation Fund. J began receiving a dis-
ability  pension  at  age  55  when  J  could 
no  longer  continue  working  because  of 
J’s disability. Under J’s pension plan, at 
age  55,  J  is  entitled  to  an  early  retire-
ment  benefit  of  $2,500.  If  J  waits  until 
age 62, normal retirement age under the 
plan, J would be entitled to a normal re-
tirement benefit of $3,000 a month. The 
pension  plan  provides  that  a  participant 
who retires early on account of disability 
is  entitled  to  receive  the  participant's 
normal  retirement  benefit,  which  in  J's 
case  equals  $3,000  per  month.  Until  J 
turns  age  62,  J  can  exclude  $500  of  the 

monthly retirement benefit from income 
(the  difference  between  the  early  retire-
ment  benefit  and  the  normal  retirement 
benefit, $3,000 - $2,500) received on ac-
count of disability. J must report the re-
maining $2,500 of monthly pension ben-
efit  as  taxable.  For  each  month  after  J 
turns  age  62,  J  must  report  the  full 
amount  of  the  monthly  pension  benefit 
($3,000 a month) as taxable.

Simplified Method

You  must  use  the  Simplified  Method  if 
either of the following applies.

1. Your annuity starting date was af-
ter July 1, 1986, and you used this meth-
od last year to figure the taxable part.

2. Your annuity starting date was af-
ter November 18, 1996, and both of the 
following apply.

a. The  payments  are  from  a  quali-
fied employee plan, a qualified employ-
ee annuity, or a tax-sheltered annuity.

b. On your annuity starting date, ei-
ther you were under age 75 or the num-
ber of years of guaranteed payments was 
fewer than 5. See Pub. 575 for the defi-
nition of guaranteed payments.

If you must use the Simplified Meth-
od,  complete  the  Simplified  Method 
Worksheet in these instructions to figure 
the taxable part of your pension or annu-
ity.  For  more  details  on  the  Simplified 
Method,  see  Pub.  575  (or  Pub.  721  for 
U.S. Civil Service retirement benefits).

If you received U.S. Civil Serv-
ice  retirement  benefits  and  you 
chose  the  alternative  annuity 
option,  see  Pub.  721  to  figure  the  taxa-
ble part of your annuity. Do not use the 
Simplified  Method  Worksheet  in  these 
instructions.

Annuity Starting Date

Your annuity starting date is the later of 
the first day of the first period for which 
you  received  a  payment  or  the  date  the 
plan's obligations became fixed.

Age (or Combined Ages) at 
Annuity Starting Date

If  you  are  the  retiree,  use  your  age  on 
the  annuity  starting  date.  If  you  are  the 
survivor of a retiree, use the retiree's age 
on their annuity starting date. But if your

annuity starting date was after 1997 and 
the payments are for your life and that of 
your  beneficiary,  use  your  combined 
ages on the annuity starting date.

If  you  are  the  beneficiary  of  an  em-
ployee  who  died,  see  Pub.  575.  If  there 
is  more  than  one  beneficiary,  see  Pub. 
575  or  Pub.  721  to  figure  each  benefi-
ciary's taxable amount.

Cost

Your  cost  is  generally  your  net  invest-
ment in the plan as of the annuity start-
ing  date.  It  doesn't  include  pre-tax  con-
tributions.  Your  net  investment  may  be 
shown in box 9b of Form 1099-R.

Rollovers

Generally, a rollover is a tax-free distri-
bution  of  cash  or  other  assets  from  one 
retirement plan that is contributed to an-
other  plan  within  60  days  of  receiving 
the distribution. However, a rollover to a 
Roth  IRA  or  a  designated  Roth  account 
is  generally  not  a  tax-free  distribution. 
Use lines 5a and 5b to report a rollover, 
including  a  direct  rollover,  from  one 
qualified  employer's  plan  to  another  or 
to an IRA or SEP.

Enter on line 5a the distribution from 
Form 1099-R, box 1. From this amount, 
subtract  any  contributions 
(usually 
shown in box 5) that were taxable to you 
when  made.  From  that  result,  subtract 
the amount of the rollover. Enter the re-
maining  amount  on  line  5b.  If  the  re-
maining amount is zero and you have no 
other  distribution  to  report  on  line  5b, 
enter  -0-  on  line  5b.  Also  enter  "Roll-
over" next to line 5b.

See Pub. 575 for more details on roll-
overs,  including  special  rules  that  apply 
to  rollovers  from  designated  Roth  ac-
counts, partial rollovers of property, and 
distributions  under  qualified  domestic 
relations orders.

Lump-Sum Distributions

If you received a lump-sum distribution 
from a profit-sharing or retirement plan, 
your Form 1099-R should have the "To-
tal distribution" box in box 2b checked. 
You  may  owe  an  additional  tax  if  you 
received  an  early  distribution  from  a 
qualified  retirement  plan  and  the  total 
amount  wasn't  rolled  over.  For  details, 

see  the  instructions  for  Schedule  2, 
line 8.

Enter the total distribution on line 5a 
and  the  taxable  part  on  line  5b.  For  de-
tails, see Pub. 575.

If  you  or  the  plan  participant 
was  born  before  January  2, 
1936, you could pay less tax on 

the distribution. See Form 4972.

Lines 6a, 6b, and 6c

Lines 6a and 6b
Social Security Benefits
You  should  receive  a  Form  SSA-1099 
showing in box 3 the total social securi-
ty benefits paid to you. Box 4 will show 
the amount of any benefits you repaid in 
2022. If you received railroad retirement 
benefits  treated  as  social  security,  you 
should receive a Form RRB-1099.

Use 

the  Social  Security  Benefits 
Worksheet in these instructions to see if 
any of your benefits are taxable.
Exception.  Do  not  use  the  Social  Se-
curity  Benefits  Worksheet  in  these  in-
structions  if  any  of  the  following  ap-
plies.

• You made contributions to a tradi-
tional  IRA  for  2022  and  you  or  your 
spouse  were  covered  by  a  retirement 
plan  at  work  or  through  self-employ-
ment.  Instead,  use  the  worksheets  in 
Pub.  590-A  to  see  if  any  of  your  social 
security  benefits  are  taxable  and  to  fig-
ure your IRA deduction.

• You  repaid  any  benefits  in  2022 
and  your  total  repayments  (box  4)  were 
more  than  your  total  benefits  for  2022 
(box 3). None of your benefits are taxa-
ble  for  2022.  Also,  if  your  total  repay-
ments in 2022 exceed your total benefits 
received  in  2022  by  more  than  $3,000, 
you may be able to take an itemized de-
duction or a credit for part of the excess 
repayments if they were for benefits you 
included  in  income  in  an  earlier  year. 
For more details, see Pub. 915.

• You  file  Form  2555,  4563,  or 
8815, or you exclude employer-provided 
adoption  benefits  or  income  from  sour-
ces  within  Puerto  Rico.  Instead,  use  the 
worksheet in Pub. 915.

Disability  payments.  Don’t  include  in 
your  income  any  disability  payments 
(including Social Security Disability In-

for injuries incurred as a direct result of 
a  terrorist  attack  directed  against  the 
United States (or its allies), whether out-
side  or  within  the  United  States.  In  the 
case  of  the  September  11  attacks,  inju-
ries eligible for coverage by the Septem-
ber  11  Victim  Compensation  Fund  are 
treated  as  incurred  as  a  direct  result  of 
the  attack.  If  these  payments  are  incor-
rectly  reported  as  taxable  on  Form 
SSA-1099,  don't  include  the  nontaxable 
portion  of  income  on  your  tax  return. 
You  may  receive  a  notice  from  the  IRS 
regarding the omitted payments. Follow 
the  instructions  in  the  notice  to  explain 
that  the  excluded  payments  aren't  taxa-
ble.  For  more  information  about  these 
payments, see Pub. 3920.

Example.  Taxpayer  X,  a  firefighter, 
was  disabled  as  a  direct  result  of  the 
September  11  terrorist  attack  on  the 
World  Trade  Center.  X  began  receiving 
Social  Security  Disability  Insurance 
(SSDI) benefits at age 54. X's full retire-
ment  age  for  social  security  retirement 
benefits  is  age  66.  X's  birthday  is  April 
25. In the year X turned 66, X received 
$1,500  per  month  in  benefits  from  the 
Social Security Administration (for a to-
tal of $18,000). Because X became eligi-
ble for a full retirement benefit in May, 
the  month  after  X  turned  66,  X  can  ex-
clude only four months (January through 
April) of their annual benefit from their 
income  ($6,000).  X  must  report  the  re-
maining $12,000 on line 6a. X must also 
complete  the  Social  Security  Benefits 
Worksheet to find out if any part of the 
$12,000 is taxable.

Capital Gain or (Loss)
If  you  sold  a  capital  asset,  such  as  a 
stock  or  bond,  you  must  complete  and 
attach Form 8949 and Schedule D.
Exception  1.  You  don’t  have  to  file 
Form  8949  or  Schedule  D  if  you  aren’t 
deferring  any  capital  gain  by  investing 
in a qualified opportunity fund and both 
of the following apply.

1. You  have  no  capital  losses,  and 
your  only  capital  gains  are  capital  gain 
distributions  from  Form(s)  1099-DIV, 
box 2a (or substitute statements); and

2. None  of  the  Form(s)  1099-DIV 
(or  substitute  statements)  have  an 
amount in box 2b (unrecaptured section 
1250  gain),  box  2c  (section  1202  gain), 
or box 2d (collectibles (28%) gain).

Exception 2.  You must file Schedule D 
but  generally  don’t  have  to  file  Form 
8949  if  Exception  1  doesn't  apply,  you 
aren’t  deferring  any  capital  gain  by  in-
vesting  in  a  qualified  opportunity  fund 
or  terminating  deferral  from  an  invest-
ment  in  a  qualified  opportunity  fund, 
and  your  only  capital  gains  and  losses 
are:

sis  was  reported  to  the  IRS,  the  QOF 
box  in  box  3  isn’t  checked,  and  you 
don’t  need  to  make  any  adjustments  in 
column  (g)  of  Form  8949  or  enter  any 
codes in column (f) of Form 8949.

If Exception 1 applies, enter your to-
tal  capital  gain  distributions 
(from 
box  2a  of  Form(s)  1099-DIV)  on  line  7 
and check the box on that line. If you re-
ceived  capital  gain  distributions  as  a

but actually belong to someone else), re-
port  on  line  7  only  the  amount  that  be-
longs to you. Include a statement show-
ing the full amount you received and the 
amount you received as a nominee. See 
the Schedule B instructions for filing re-
quirements  for  Forms  1099-DIV  and

In  most  cases,  your  federal  income  tax 
will be less if you take the larger of your 
itemized  deductions  or  standard  deduc-
tion.

Itemized Deductions

To  figure  your  itemized  deductions,  fill 
in Schedule A.

If you made a section 962 elec-
tion and are taking a deduction 
under  section  250  with  respect 
to  any  income  inclusions  under  section 
951 or 951A, don't report the deduction 
on  line  12.  Instead,  report  the  tax  with 
respect  to  a  section  962  election  on 
line  16  and  include  in  the  statement  re-
quired  by  line  16  how  you  figured  the 
section 250 deduction.

Standard Deduction

Most  Form  1040  filers  can  find  their 
standard  deduction  by  looking  at  the 
amounts  listed  to  the  left  of  line  12. 
Most Form 1040-SR filers can find their 
standard deduction by using the chart on 
the last page of Form 1040-SR.
Exception 
you 
checked the “Someone can claim you as 
a  dependent”  box,  or  if  you’re  filing 
jointly  and  you  checked  the  “Someone 
can  claim  your  spouse  as  a  dependent” 
box,  use  the  Standard  Deduction  Work-
sheet  for  Dependents  to  figure  your 
standard deduction.

Someone  claims  you  or  your 
spouse  as  a  dependent  if  they 
list your or your spouse's name 
and  SSN  in  the  Dependents  section  of 
their return.

Exception  2—Born  before  January  2, 
1958,  or  blind.  If  you  checked  any  of 
the  following  boxes,  figure  your  stand-
ard deduction using the Standard Deduc-
tion  Chart  for  People  Who  Were  Born 
Before  January  2,  1958,  or  Were  Blind 
if you are filing Form 1040 or by using 
the  chart  on  the  last  page  of  Form 
1040-SR.

• You are blind.
• Spouse was born before January 2, 

1958.

1958.

• Spouse is blind.

Exception  3—Separate  return  or  du-
al-status  alien.  If  you  checked  the  box 
labeled “Spouse itemizes on separate re-
turn  or  you  were  dual-status  alien”  on 
the Spouse standard deduction line, your 
standard  deduction  is  zero,  even  if  you 
were  born  before  January  2,  1958,  or 
were blind.
Exception  4—Increased  standard  de-
duction for net qualified disaster loss.

• Recapture  of  an  education  credit. 
You may owe this tax if you claimed an 
education  credit  in  an  earlier  year,  and 
either  tax-free  educational  assistance  or 
a  refund  of  qualified  expenses  was  re-
ceived in 2022 for the student. See Form

965(i), check box 3 and enter (as a nega-
tive number) the amount of the deferred 
net  965  tax  liability  and  “965”  on  the

Do  you  want  the  IRS  to  figure  the 

tax on your taxable income for you?

  Yes.  See  chapter  13  of  Pub.  17  for 
details,  including  who  is  eligible  and 
what  to  do.  If  you  have  paid  too  much, 
we will send you a refund. If you didn't 
pay enough, we will send you a bill.

 No.  Use one of the following meth-

ods to figure your tax.
Tax  Table  or  Tax  Computation 
Worksheet.  If  your  taxable  income  is 
less  than  $100,000,  you  must  use  the 
Tax Table, later in these instructions, to 
figure your tax. Be sure you use the cor-

rect  column.  If  your  taxable  income  is 
$100,000  or  more,  use  the  Tax  Compu-
tation Worksheet right after the Tax Ta-
ble.

However, don’t use the Tax Table or 
Tax  Computation  Worksheet  to  figure 
your tax if any of the following applies.
Form  8615.  Form  8615  must  generally 
be  used  to  figure  the  tax  on  your  un-
earned  income  over  $2,300  if  you  are 
under age 18, and in certain situations if 
you are older.

You must file Form 8615 if you meet 

all of the following conditions.

1. You had more than $2,300 of un-
earned income (such as taxable interest, 
ordinary  dividends,  or  capital  gains  (in-
cluding capital gain distributions)).

2. You  are  required  to  file  a  tax  re-

turn.

3. You were either:
a. Under age 18 at the end of 2022,
b. Age  18  at  the  end  of  2022  and 
didn't have earned income that was more 
than half of your support, or

c. A full-time student at least age 19 
but under age 24 at the end of 2022 and 
didn't have earned income that was more 
than half of your support.

4. At  least  one  of  your  parents  was 

alive at the end of 2022.

5. You  don’t  file  a  joint  return  in 

2022.

A  child  born  on  January  1,  2005,  is 
considered  to  be  age  18  at  the  end  of 
2022; a child born on January 1, 2004, is 
considered  to  be  age  19  at  the  end  of 
2022;  and  a  child  born  on  January  1, 
1999,  is  considered  to  be  age  24  at  the 
end of 2022.
Schedule  D  Tax  Worksheet.  Use  the 
Schedule  D  Tax  Worksheet  in  the  In-
structions  for  Schedule  D  to  figure  the 
amount  to  enter  on  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR, line 16, if:

• You  have  to  file  Schedule  D,  and 
line 18 or 19 of Schedule D is more than 
zero; or

• You  have  to  file  Form  4952  and 
you  have  an  amount  on  line  4g,  even  if 
you don’t need to file Schedule D.

But if you are filing Form 2555, you 
must  use  the  Foreign  Earned  Income 
Tax Worksheet instead.

Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain 
Tax  Worksheet.  Use 
the  Qualified 
Dividends  and  Capital  Gain  Tax  Work-
sheet,  later,  to  figure  your  tax  if  you 
don’t  have  to  use  the  Schedule  D  Tax 
Worksheet  and  if  any  of  the  following 
applies.

• You  reported  qualified  dividends 

on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 3a.

• You don’t have to file Schedule D 
and  you  reported  capital  gain  distribu-
tions on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 7.

• You  are  filing  Schedule  D,  and 
Schedule  D,  lines  15  and  16,  are  both 
more than zero.

But if you are filing Form 2555, you 
must  use  the  Foreign  Earned  Income 
Tax Worksheet instead.

farming  or  fishing  (including  certain 
amounts received in connection with the

income averaging on Schedule J.
Foreign  Earned  Income  Tax  Work-

you use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 4 (line 10 if you use the 
Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess, subtract 
Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 15, from line 4 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax 
Worksheet). If the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.

If you don’t have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet's instructions. Then, 

complete lines 5 and 6 above.

If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet 
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then, complete lines 5 and 6 above. 
These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.

1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet 
or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess. 
2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet 
or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for 
Schedule D (Form 1040).

Child Tax Credit and Credit 
for Other Dependents
Use  Schedule  8812  (Form  1040)  to  fig-
ure  your  child  tax  credit  and  credit  for 
other dependents.
Form  8862,  who  must  file.  You  must 
file  Form  8862  to  claim  the  child  tax 
credit  or  credit  for  other  dependents  if 
your child tax credit (refundable or non-
refundable  depending  on  the  tax  year), 
additional  child  tax  credit,  or  credit  for 
other  dependents  for  a  year  after  2015 
was  denied  or  reduced  for  any  reason 
other  than  a  math  or  clerical  error.  At-
tach  a  completed  Form  8862  to  your 
2022 return. Don’t file Form 8862 if you 
filed Form 8862 for 2021, and the child 
tax credit (refundable or nonrefundable), 
additional  child  tax  credit,  or  credit  for 
other  dependents  was  allowed  for  that 
year. See Form 8862 and its instructions 
for details.

If  you  take  the  child  tax  credit 
or  credit  for  other  dependents 
even  though  you  aren't  eligible 
and  it  is  determined  that  your  error  is 
due  to  reckless  or  intentional  disregard 
of  the  rules  for  these  credits,  you  won't 
be  allowed  to  take  either  credit  or  the 
additional  child  tax  credit  for  2  years 
even  if  you're  otherwise  eligible  to  do 
so.  If  you  take  the  child  tax  credit  or 
credit for other dependents even though 
you  aren’t  eligible  and  it  is  later  deter-
mined  that  you  fraudulently  took  either 
credit,  you  won't  be  allowed  to  take  ei-
ther  credit  or  the  additional  child  tax 
credit  for  10  years.  You  may  also  have 
to pay penalties.

If  your  qualifying  child  didn’t 
have  an  SSN  valid  for  employ-
ment issued before the due date 
of  your  2022  return  (including  exten-
sions),  you  can’t  claim  the  child  tax 
credit for that child on your original or 
amended  return.  However,  you  may  be 
able  to  claim  the  credit  for  other  de-
pendents for that child.

Earned Income Credit (EIC)

work and is valid for EIC purposes (explained later under 
Definitions and Special Rules)?

Yes.  Continue

No.

What Is the EIC?
The EIC is a credit for certain people who work. The credit may 
give you a refund even if you don’t owe any tax or didn’t have 
any tax withheld.

To Take the EIC:

• Follow the steps below.
• Complete the worksheet that applies to you or let the IRS 

figure the credit for you.

• If you have a qualifying child, complete and attach Sched-

ule EIC.

• If you have at least one child who meets the conditions to 
be your qualifying child for purposes of claiming the EIC, com-
plete and attach Schedule EIC, even if that child doesn't have a 
valid  SSN.  See  Schedule  EIC  for  more  information,  including 
how to complete Schedule EIC if your qualifying child doesn't 
have a valid SSN.

For help in determining if you are eligible for the EIC, go to
IRS.gov/EITC and click on “EITC Qualification Assistant.” This 
service is available in English and Spanish.

If you take the EIC even though you aren't eligible and 
it is determined that your error is due to reckless or in-
tentional  disregard  of  the  EIC  rules,  you  won't  be  al-
lowed to take the credit for 2 years even if you are otherwise el-
igible  to  do  so.  If  you  fraudulently  take  the  EIC,  you  won't  be 
allowed  to  take  the  credit  for  10  years.  See  Form  8862,  who 
must file, later. You may also have to pay penalties.

Refunds for returns claiming the earned income credit 
can't  be  issued  before  mid-February  2023.  This  delay 
applies to the entire refund, not just the portion associ-

ated with the earned income credit.

Step 3

Qualifying Child

A qualifying child for the EIC is a child who is your...

Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, 
half brother, half sister, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your 
grandchild, niece, or nephew)

was ...

Under age 19 at the end of 2022 and younger than you 
(or your spouse if filing jointly)

or

Under age 24 at the end of 2022, a student (defined later), and younger than 
you (or your spouse if filing jointly)

Any age and permanently and totally disabled (defined later)

Who isn't filing a joint return for 2022 
or is filing a joint return for 2022 only to claim a refund of withheld income 
tax or estimated tax paid (see Pub. 596 for examples)

Who lived with you in the United States for more than half of 2022.

You can't take the credit for a child who didn't live with you for more 

than half the year, even if you paid most of the child's living expenses. The 
IRS may ask you for documents to show you lived with each qualifying child. 
Documents you might want to keep for this purpose include school and child 
care records and other records that show your child's address.

If the child didn't live with you for more than half of 2022 because of 

a temporary absence, birth, death, or kidnapping, see Exception to time 
lived with you, later.

If the child meets the conditions to be a qualifying child of any other 

person (other than your spouse, if filing a joint return) for 2022, see 
Qualifying child of more than one person, later. If the child was married, see 
Married child, later.

3. You can elect to include this pay in your earned income when 
figuring  the  EIC.  The  amount  of  your  nontaxable  combat  pay 
should be shown in box 12 of Form(s) W-2 with code Q. If you 
are filing a joint return and both you and your spouse received 
nontaxable combat pay, you can each make your own election. 
In other words, if one of you makes the election, the other one 
can also make it but doesn't have to.

If you elect to use your nontaxable combat pay in fig-
uring your EIC, enter that amount on line 1i.

If  you  have  a  qualifying  child,  complete  and  attach 
Schedule EIC. If your EIC for a year after 1996 was reduced or

Exception to time lived with you.  Temporary absences by you 
or the child for special circumstances, such as school, vacation, 
business, medical care, military service, or detention in a juve-
nile  facility,  count  as  time  the  child  lived  with  you.  Also  see 
Kidnapped child under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, earli-
er, and Members of the military, later. A child is considered to 
have lived with you for more than half of 2022 if the child was 
born or died in 2022 and your home was this child's home for 
more  than  half  the  time  the  child  was  alive  in  2022  or  if  you 
adopted  the  child  in  2022,  the  child  was  lawfully  placed  with 
you for legal adoption by you in 2022, or the child was an eligi-
ble  foster  child  placed  with  you  during  2022  and  your  main 
home  was  the  child's  main  home  for  more  than  half  the  time 
since the child was adopted or placed with you in 2022.

Form  4797  filers.  If  the  amount  on  Form  1040  or  1040-SR, 
line  7,  includes  an  amount  from  Form  4797,  you  must  use 
Worksheet 1 in Pub. 596 to see if you can take the EIC. Other-
wise, stop; you can't take the EIC.
Form  8862,  who  must  file.  You  must  file  Form  8862  if  your 
EIC  for  a  year  after  1996  was  reduced  or  disallowed  for  any 

reason  other  than  a  math  or  clerical  error.  But  don’t  file  Form 
8862 if either of the following applies.

• You  filed  Form  8862  for  another  year,  the  EIC  was  al-
lowed for that year, and your EIC hasn't been reduced or disal-
lowed again for any reason other than a math or clerical error.

• You are taking the EIC without a qualifying child and the 
only  reason  your  EIC  was  reduced  or  disallowed  in  the  other 
year was because it was determined that a child listed on Sched-
ule EIC wasn't your qualifying child.

 Also, don’t file Form 8862 or take the credit for the:
• 2 years after the most recent tax year for which there was 
a final determination that your EIC claim was due to reckless or 
intentional disregard of the EIC rules, or

• 10 years after the most recent tax year for which there was 

a final determination that your EIC claim was due to fraud.
Foster child.  A foster child is any child placed with you by an 
authorized  placement  agency  or  by  judgment,  decree,  or  other 
order of any court of competent jurisdiction. For more details on 
authorized placement agencies, see Pub. 596.

Married child.  A child who was married at the end of 2022 is 
a qualifying child only if (a) you can claim the child as your de-
pendent,  or  (b)  you  could  have  claimed  the  child  as  your  de-
pendent except for the special rule for Children of divorced or 
separated parents under Who Qualifies as Your Dependent, ear-
lier.
Members of the military.  If you were on extended active duty 
outside the United States, your main home is considered to be in 
the United States during that duty period. Extended active duty 
is military duty ordered for an indefinite period or for a period 
of more than 90 days. Once you begin serving extended active 
duty, you are considered to be on extended active duty even if 
you don’t serve more than 90 days.

Nonresident aliens.  If your filing status is married filing joint-
ly, go to Step 2. Otherwise, stop; you can't take the EIC. Enter 
“No” on the dotted line next to line 27.

Permanently  and  totally  disabled.  A  person  is  permanently 
and totally disabled if, at any time in 2022, the person couldn't 
engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a physical 
or mental condition and a doctor has determined that this condi-
tion (a) has lasted or can be expected to last continuously for at 
least a year, or (b) can be expected to lead to death.
Qualifying  child  of  more  than  one  person.  Even  if  a  child 
meets the conditions to be the qualifying child of more than one 
person, only one person can claim the child as a qualifying child 
for all of the following tax benefits, unless the special rule for 
Children of divorced or separated parents under Who Qualifies 
as Your Dependent, earlier, applies.

1. Child  tax  credit,  credit  for  other  dependents,  and  addi-

tional child tax credit (lines 19 and 28).

14:28 - 20-Jan-2023

The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing.

No other person can take any of the five tax benefits just listed 
based on the qualifying child. If you and any other person can 
claim the child as a qualifying child, the following rules apply. 
For purposes of these rules, the term “parent”means a biological 
or adoptive parent of an individual. It doesn't include a steppar-
ent or foster parent unless that person has adopted the individu-
al.

• If only one of the persons is the child's parent, the child is 

treated as the qualifying child of the parent.

• If the parents file a joint return together and can claim the 
child as a qualifying child, the child is treated as the qualifying 
child of the parents.

• If the parents don’t file a joint return together but both pa-
rents claim the child as a qualifying child, the IRS will treat the 
child as the qualifying child of the parent with whom the child 
lived  for  the  longer  period  of  time  in  2022.  If  the  child  lived 
with each parent for the same amount of time, the IRS will treat 
the child as the qualifying child of the parent who had the high-
er adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2022.

• If no parent can claim the child as a qualifying child, the 
child is treated as the qualifying child of the person who had the 
highest AGI for 2022.

• If a parent can claim the child as a qualifying child but no 
parent does so claim the child, the child is treated as the qualify-
ing child of the person who had the highest AGI for 2022, but 
only if that person's AGI is higher than the highest AGI of any 
parent of the child who can claim the child.

If, under these rules, you can't claim a child as a quali-
fying  child  for  the  EIC,  you  may  be  able  to  claim  the 
EIC under the rules for a taxpayer without a qualifying 

child. For more information, see Pub. 596.

Example.  Your child J, meets the conditions to be a qualify-
ing child for both you and your parent. J doesn't meet the condi-
tions to be a qualifying child of any other person, including J’s 
other parent. Under the rules just described, you can claim J as a 
qualifying  child  for  all  of  the  five  tax  benefits  listed  here  for 
which you otherwise qualify. Your parent can't claim any of the 
five  tax  benefits  listed  here  based  on  J.  However,  if  your  pa-
rent’s AGI is higher than yours and you don’t claim J as a quali-
fying child, J is the qualifying child of your parent.
For more details and examples, see Pub. 596.

Social security number (SSN).  For the EIC, a valid SSN is a 
number  issued  by  the  Social  Security  Administration  unless 
“Not  Valid  for  Employment”  is  printed  on  the  social  security 
card and the number was issued solely to allow the recipient of 
the SSN to apply for or receive a federally funded benefit. How-
ever, if “Valid for Work Only With DHS Authorization” is prin-
ted on your social security card, your SSN is valid for EIC pur-
poses only as long as the DHS authorization is still valid.

To find out how to get an SSN, see Social Security Number 
(SSN)  near  the  beginning  of  these  instructions.  If  you  won't 
have  an  SSN  by  the  date  your  return  is  due,  see  What  if  You 
Can't File on Time?

If you didn't have an SSN issued on or before the due date of 
your 2022 return (including extensions), you can't claim the EIC 
on  your  original  or  an  amended  2022  return.  If  a  child  didn't 
have an SSN issued on or before the due date of your return (in-
cluding  extensions),  you  can't  count  that  child  as  a  qualifying 
child in figuring the amount of the EIC on your original or an 
amended 2022 return.
Student.  A student is a child who during any part of 5 calendar 
months of 2022 was enrolled as a full-time student at a school 
or took a full-time, on-farm training course given by a school or 
a state, county, or local government agency. A school includes a 
technical,  trade,  or  mechanical  school.  It  doesn't  include  an 
on-the-job training course, correspondence school, or school of-
fering courses only through the Internet.

Welfare benefits, effect of credit on.  Any refund you receive 
as  a  result  of  taking  the  EIC  can't  be  counted  as  income  when 
determining if you or anyone else is eligible for benefits or as-
sistance,  or  how  much  you  or  anyone  else  can  receive,  under 
any  federal  program  or  under  any  state  or  local  program  fi-
nanced in whole or in part with federal funds. These programs 
include  Temporary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families  (TANF), 
Medicaid,  Supplemental  Security  Income  (SSI),  and  Supple-
mental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps). In 
addition, when determining eligibility, the refund can't be coun-
ted  as  a  resource  for  at  least  12  months  after  you  receive  it. 
Check with your local benefit coordinator to find out if your re-
fund will affect your benefits.

Additional Child Tax Credit
See Schedule 8812 (Form 1040) and its 
instructions  for  information  on  figuring 
and  claiming  any  additional  child  tax 
credit  that  you  may  qualify  to  claim.  If 
you are claiming the additional child tax 
credit,  complete  Schedule  8812  and  at-
tach it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
Form  8862,  who  must  file.  You  must 
file  Form  8862  to  claim  the  additional 
child  tax  credit  if  your  child  tax  credit 
(refundable or nonrefundable depending 
on  the  tax  year),  additional  child  tax 
credit, or credit for other dependents for 
a year after 2015 was denied or reduced 
for any reason other than a math or cleri-
cal error. Attach a completed Form 8862 
to  your  2022  return  to  claim  the  credit 
for  2022.  Don't  file  Form  8862  if  you 
filed  Form  8862  for  2021  and  the  child 
tax credit (refundable or nonrefundable), 
additional  child  tax  credit,  or  credit  for 
other  dependents  was  allowed  for  that 
year. See Form 8862 and its instructions 
for details.

If you take the additional child 
tax  credit  even  though  you 
aren't  eligible  and  it  is  deter-
mined that your error is due to reckless 
or intentional disregard of the addition-
al child tax credit rules, you won't be al-
lowed  to  take  the  child  tax  credit,  the 
credit for other dependents, or the addi-
tional child tax credit for 2 years even if 
you’re otherwise eligible to do so. If you 
take the additional child tax credit even 
though you aren’t eligible and it is later 
determined  that  you  fraudulently  took 
the credit, you won't be allowed to take 
the  child  tax  credit,  the  credit  for  other 
dependents,  or  the  additional  child  tax 
credit  for  10  years.  You  may  also  have 
to pay penalties.

Refunds  for  returns  claiming 
the  additional  child  tax  credit 
can't be issued before mid-Feb-
ruary 2023. This delay applies to the en-
tire  refund,  not  just  the  portion  associ-
ated with the additional child tax credit.

American Opportunity 
Credit
If you meet the requirements to claim an 
education credit (see the instructions for 
Schedule 3, line 3), enter on line 29 the 
amount, if any, from Form 8863, line 8. 
You  may  be  able  to  increase  an  educa-
tion  credit  and  reduce  your  total  tax  or 
increase  your  tax  refund  if  the  student 
chooses  to  include  all  or  part  of  a  Pell 
grant or certain other scholarships or fel-
lowships  in  income.  See  Pub.  970  and 
the Instructions for Form 8863 for more 
information.
Form  8862  required.  You  must  file 
Form 8862 if your American opportuni-
ty  credit  for  a  year  after  2015  was  de-
nied  or  reduced  for  any  reason  other 
than  a  math  or  clerical  error.  Attach  a 
completed  Form  8862  to  your  2022  re-
turn  to  claim  the  credit  for  2022.  Don't 
file  Form  8862  if  you  filed  Form  8862 
for  2021  and  the  American  opportunity 
credit  was  allowed  for  that  year.  See 
Form  8862  and  its  instructions  for  de-
tails.

If  you  take  the  American  op-
portunity  credit  even  though 
you aren't eligible and it is de-
termined that your error is due to reck-
less  or  intentional  disregard  of  the 
American  opportunity  credit  rules,  you 
won't be allowed to take the credit for 2 
years even if you’re otherwise eligible to 
do so. If you take the American opportu-
nity credit even though you aren't eligi-
ble and it is determined that you fraudu-
lently  took  the  credit,  you  won't  be  al-
lowed  to  take  the  credit  for  10  years. 
You may also have to pay penalties.

Refund

Line 34

Amount Overpaid
If line 34 is under $1, we will send a re-
fund only on written request.

Refund Offset

If you owe past-due federal tax, state in-
come  tax,  state  unemployment  compen-
sation debts, child support, spousal sup-
port,  or  certain  federal  nontax  debts, 
such  as  student  loans,  all  or  part  of  the 
overpayment  on  line  34  may  be  used 
(offset) to pay the past-due amount. Off-
sets  for  federal  taxes  are  made  by  the 
IRS.  All  other  offsets  are  made  by  the 
Treasury  Department's  Bureau  of  the 
Fiscal  Service.  For  federal  tax  offsets, 
you  will  receive  a  notice  from  the  IRS. 
For  all  other  offsets,  you  will  receive  a 
notice  from  the  Fiscal  Service.  To  find 
out  if  you  may  have  an  offset  or  if  you 
have  any  questions  about  it,  contact  the 
agency to which you owe the debt.

Deposit Refund into Multiple 
Accounts

If  you  want  your  refund  to  be  split  and 
direct  deposited  into  more  than  one  ac-
count,  file  Form  8888.  Use  Form  8888 
to  direct  deposit  your  refund  (or  part  of 
it) to one or more accounts in your name 
at  a  bank  or  other  financial  institution 
(such  as  a  mutual  fund,  brokerage  firm, 
or credit union) in the United States.

Injured Spouse

If you file a joint return and your spouse 
hasn’t paid past-due federal tax, state in-
come  tax,  state  unemployment  compen-
sation debts, child support, spousal sup-
port, or a federal nontax debt, such as a 
student  loan,  part  or  all  of  the  overpay-
ment on line 34 may be used (offset) to 
pay  the  past-due  amount.  But  your  part 
of  the  overpayment  may  be  refunded  to 
you  if  certain  conditions  apply  and  you 
complete  Form  8379.  For  details  see 
Form 8379.

Lines 35a Through 35d

Amount Refunded to You
If  you  want  to  check  the  status  of  your 
refund, just use the IRS2Go app or go to 
IRS.gov/Refunds.  See  Refund  Informa-
tion,  later.  Information  about  your  re-
fund  will  generally  be  available  within 
24  hours  after  the  IRS  receives  your 
e-filed return, or 4 weeks after you mail 
your  paper  return.  If  you  filed  Form 
8379  with  your  return,  wait  14  weeks

Have your 2022 tax return handy so you 
can  enter  your  social  security  number, 
your  filing  status,  and  the  exact  whole 
dollar amount of your refund.

Where's  My  Refund  will  provide  a 
personalized  refund  date  as  soon  as  the 
IRS processes your tax return and appro-
ves your refund.
Effect  of  refund  on  benefits.  Any  re-
fund you receive can't be counted as in-
come  when  determining  if  you  or  any-
one  else  is  eligible  for  benefits  or 
assistance,  or  how  much  you  or  anyone 
else  can  receive,  under  any  federal  pro-
gram or under any state or local program 
financed in whole or in part with federal 
funds.  These  programs  include  Tempo-
rary  Assistance  for  Needy  Families 
(TANF),  Medicaid,  Supplemental  Se-
curity  Income  (SSI),  and  Supplemental 
Nutrition  Assistance  Program  (formerly 
food  stamps).  In  addition,  when  deter-
mining  eligibility,  the  refund  can't  be 
counted  as  a  resource  for  at  least  12 
months after you receive it. Check with 
your local benefit coordinator to find out 
if your refund will affect your benefits.

Fast Refunds! Join the eight in 10 taxpayers 
who choose direct deposit—a fast, simple, safe, 
secure way to have your refund deposited 
automatically to your checking or savings 
account, including an individual retirement 
arrangement (IRA). See the information about 
IRAs, later.

If you want us to directly deposit the 
amount  shown  on  line  35a  to  your 
checking  or  savings  account,  including 
an  IRA,  at  a  bank  or  other  financial  in-
stitution (such as a mutual fund, broker-
age  firm,  or  credit  union)  in  the  United 
States:

• Complete lines 35b through 35d (if 
you  want  your  refund  deposited  to  only 
one account), or

• Check the box on line 35a and at-
tach Form 8888 if you want to split the 
direct  deposit  of  your  refund  into  more 
than  one  account  or  use  all  or  part  of 
your refund to buy paper series I savings 
bonds.

If you don’t want your refund direct-
ly  deposited  to  your  account,  don’t 

check  the  box  on  line  35a.  Draw  a  line 
through the boxes on lines 35b and 35d. 
We will send you a check instead.
Account must be in your name.  Don’t 
request  a  deposit  of  your  refund  to  an 
account  that  isn't  in  your  name,  such  as 
your  tax  return  preparer’s  account.  Al-
though  you  may  owe  your  tax  return 
preparer a fee for preparing your return, 
don’t  have  any  part  of  your  refund  de-
posited into the preparer's account to pay 
the fee.

The number of refunds that can be di-
rectly  deposited  to  a  single  account  or 
prepaid  debit  card  is  limited  to  three  a 
year.  After  this  limit  is  reached,  paper 
checks will be sent instead. Learn more 
at IRS.gov/DepositLimit.

Why Use Direct Deposit?

• You  get  your  refund  faster  by  di-

rect deposit than you do by check.

• Payment  is  more  secure.  There  is 

no check that can get lost or stolen.

• It  is  more  convenient.  You  don’t 
have to make a trip to the bank to depos-
it your check.

• It  saves  tax  dollars.  It  costs  the 
government  less  to  refund  by  direct  de-
posit.

• It's  proven  itself.  Nearly  98%  of 
social security and veterans' benefits are 
sent electronically using direct deposit.

If  you  file  a  joint  return  and 
check  the  box  on  line  35a  and 
attach  Form  8888  or  fill  in 
lines 35b through 35d, your spouse may 
get at least part of the refund.

IRA.  You can have your refund (or part 
of  it)  directly  deposited  to  a  traditional 
IRA,  Roth  IRA,  or  SEP-IRA,  but  not  a 
SIMPLE  IRA.  You  must  establish  the 
IRA at a bank or other financial institu-
tion  before  you  request  direct  deposit. 
Make  sure  your  direct  deposit  will  be 
accepted. You must also notify the trust-
ee  or  custodian  of  your  account  of  the 
year to which the deposit is to be applied 
(unless the trustee or custodian won't ac-
cept  a  deposit  for  2022).  If  you  don’t, 
the  trustee  or  custodian  can  assume  the 
deposit is for the year during which you 
are filing the return. For example, if you 
file  your  2022  return  during  2023  and 
don’t  notify  the  trustee  or  custodian  in 
advance, the trustee or custodian can as-
sume  the  deposit  to  your  IRA  is  for 

2023. If you designate your deposit to be 
for 2022, you must verify that the depos-
it  was  actually  made  to  the  account  by 
the  due  date  of  the  return  (not  counting 
extensions). If the deposit isn't made by 
that date, the deposit isn't an IRA contri-
bution  for  2022.  In  that  case,  you  must 
file an amended 2022 return and reduce 
any  IRA  deduction  and  any  retirement 
savings  contributions  credit  you  claim-
ed.

You  and  your  spouse,  if  filing 
jointly,  each  may  be  able  to 
contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 
if age 50 or older at the end of 2022) to 
a traditional IRA or Roth IRA for 2022. 
You may owe a penalty if your contribu-
tions  exceed  these  limits,  and  the  limits 
may  be  lower  depending  on  your  com-
pensation  and  income.  For  more  infor-
mation  on  IRA  contributions,  see  Pub.

TreasuryDirect®.  You  can  request  a 
deposit of your refund (or part of it) to a

Form  8888.  You  can  have  your  refund 
directly deposited into more than one ac-
count or use it to buy up to $5,000 in pa-
per  series  I  savings  bonds.  You  don’t 
need  a  TreasuryDirect®  account  to  do 
this. For more information, see the Form 
8888 instructions.

Your refund can be split and di-
rectly deposited into up to three 
different accounts in your name 

on Form 8888.

You  can't  file  Form  8888  to  split  your

cial  institution  instructed  them  to  use  a 
different  routing  number  for  direct  de-
posits.

Sample Check—Lines 35b Through 35d

Ask  your  financial  institution  for  the 
correct  routing  number  to  enter  on 
line 35b if:

• The  routing  number  on  a  deposit 
slip is different from the routing number 
on your checks,

• Your  deposit  is  to  a  savings  ac-
count  that  doesn't  allow  you  to  write 
checks, or

• Your checks state they are payable 
through  a  financial  institution  different 
from  the  one  at  which  you  have  your 
checking account.

Line 35c

Check  the  appropriate  box  for  the  type 
of  account.  Don’t  check  more  than  one 
box. If the deposit is to an account such 
as  an  IRA,  health  savings  account,  bro-
kerage account, or other similar account, 
ask  your  financial  institution  whether 
you  should  check  the  “Checking”  or 
“Savings” box. You must check the cor-
rect box to ensure your deposit is accep-
ted. If your deposit is to a TreasuryDir-
ect® online account, check the “Savings” 
box.

Line 35d

The  account  number  can  be  up  to  17 
characters  (both  numbers  and  letters). 
Include  hyphens  but  omit  spaces  and 
special symbols. Enter the number from 
left to right and leave any unused boxes 
blank. On the sample check shown later, 
the  account  number  is  20202086.  Don’t 
include the check number.

If  the  direct  deposit  to  your  ac-
count(s)  is  different  from  the  amount 
you  expected,  you  will  receive  an  ex-
planation in the mail about 2 weeks after 
your refund is deposited.

Reasons Your Direct Deposit 
Request Will Be Rejected

If any of the following apply, your direct 
deposit  request  will  be  rejected  and  a 
check will be sent instead.

• You  are  asking  to  have  a  joint  re-
fund deposited to an individual account, 
and your financial institution(s) won't al-
low  this.  The  IRS  isn't  responsible  if  a 
financial  institution  rejects  a  direct  de-
posit.

• The name on your account doesn't 
match the name on the refund, and your 
financial  institution(s)  won't  allow  a  re-
fund to be deposited unless the name on 
the  refund  matches  the  name  on  the  ac-
count.

• Three  direct  deposits  of  tax  re-
funds  already  have  been  made  to  the 
same account or prepaid debit card.

• You  haven't  given  a  valid  account 

number.

• Any  numbers  or  letters  on  lines 
35b through 35d are crossed out or whi-
ted out.

The  IRS  isn't  responsible  for  a 
lost  refund  if  you  enter  the 
information.

cluding extensions)—April 18, 2023, for 
most taxpayers. You don’t have to pay if 
line 37 is under $1.

Include  any  estimated  tax  penalty 
from line 38 in the amount you enter on 
line  37.  Don’t  include  any  estimated 
payments  for  2023  in  this  payment.  In-
stead, make the estimated payment sepa-
rately.
Bad  check  or  payment.  The  penalty 
for writing a bad check to the IRS is $25 
or  2%  of  the  check,  whichever  is  more. 
However,  if  the  amount  of  the  check  is 
less  than  $25,  the  penalty  equals  the 
amount of the check. This also applies to 
other  forms  of  payment  if  the  IRS 
doesn’t receive the funds. Use Tax Topic 
206.

Pay by Cash

Cash is an in-person payment option for 
individuals provided through retail part-
ners with a maximum of $1,000 per day 
per  transaction.  To  make  a  cash  pay-
ment, you must first be registered online 
at  fed.acipayonline.com.  Do  not  send 
cash payments through the mail.

Pay by Check or Money Order

Before  submitting  a  payment  through 
the  mail,  please  consider  alternative 
methods.  One  of  our  safe,  quick,  and 
easy  electronic  payment  options  might 
be right for you. If you choose to mail a 
tax payment, make your check or money 
order  payable  to  “United  States  Treas-
ury” for the full amount due. Don’t send 
cash.  Don’t  attach  the  payment  to  your 
return.  Write  “2022  Form  1040”  or 
“2022  Form  1040-SR”  and  your  name, 
address, daytime phone number, and so-
cial security number (SSN) on your pay-
ment  and  attach  Form  1040-V.  For  the 
most  up-to-date  information  on  Form 
1040-V,  go  to  IRS.gov/Form1040V.  If 
you  are  filing  a  joint  return,  enter  the 
SSN shown first on your tax return.

To help us process your payment, en-
ter  the  amount  on  the  right  side  of  the 
check  like  this:  $  XXX.XX.  Don’t  use 
dashes or lines (for example, don’t enter 
“$ XXX–” or “$ XXXxx/100”).

Mail  your  2022  tax  return,  payment, 
and  Form  1040-V  to  the  address  shown 
on the form that applies to you.

Notice 

taxpayers  presenting 
checks.  When  you  provide  a  check  as 
payment,  you  authorize  us  either  to  use 
information  from  your  check  to  make  a 
one-time  electronic  fund  transfer  from 
your  account  or  to  process  the  payment 
as a check transaction. When we use in-
formation  from  your  check  to  make  an 
electronic  fund  transfer,  funds  may  be 
withdrawn from your account as soon as 
the same day we receive your payment, 
and  you  will  not  receive  your  check 
back from your financial institution.

No  checks  of  $100  million  or  more 
accepted.  The IRS can’t accept a single 
check  (including  a  cashier’s  check)  for 
amounts of $100,000,000 ($100 million) 
or more. If you are sending $100 million 
or more by check, you’ll need to spread 
the payment over 2 or more checks with 
each check made out for an amount less 
than $100 million. This limit doesn’t ap-
ply  to  other  methods  of  payment  (such 
as electronic payments). Please consider 
a method of payment other than check if 
the amount of the payment is over $100 
million.

What if You Can't Pay?

If  you  can't  pay  the  full  amount  shown 
on  line  37  when  you  file,  you  can  ask 
for:

• An installment agreement, or
• An extension of time to pay.

Installment  agreement.  Under  an  in-
stallment  agreement,  you  can  pay  all  or 
part  of  the  tax  you  owe  in  monthly  in-
stallments.  However,  even  if  an  install-
ment  agreement  is  granted,  you  will  be 
charged  interest  and  may  be  charged  a 
late payment penalty on the tax not paid 
by  the  due  date  of  your  return  (not 
counting  extensions)—April  18,  2023, 
for  most  people.  You  must  also  pay  a 
fee.  To  limit  the  interest  and  penalty 
charges, pay as much of the tax as possi-
ble when you file. But before requesting 
an  installment  agreement,  you  should 
consider  other  less  costly  alternatives, 
such  as  a  bank  loan  or  credit  card  pay-
ment.

To  ask  for  an  installment  agreement, 
you can apply online or use Form 9465. 
To apply online, go to IRS.gov and click 
on Apply for an Online Payment Plan.

undue  hardship,  you  can  ask  for  an  ex-
tension  of  time  to  pay  by  filing  Form 
1127 by the due date of your return (not 
counting  extensions)—April  18,  2023, 
for most people. An extension generally 
won't  be  granted  for  more 
than  6 
months. You will be charged interest on 
the tax not paid by April 15, 2023. You 
must  pay  the  tax  before  the  extension 
runs  out.  Penalties  and  interest  will  be 
imposed until taxes are paid in full. For 
the  most  up-to-date 
information  on 
Form 1127, go to IRS.gov/Form1127.

Line 38

Estimated Tax Penalty
You may owe this penalty if:

• Line 37 is at least $1,000 and it is 
more than 10% of the tax shown on your 
return, or

• You  didn't  pay  enough  estimated 
tax by any of the due dates. This is true 
even if you are due a refund.

For  most  people,  the  “tax  shown  on 
your return” is the amount on your 2022 
Form  1040  or  1040-SR,  line  24,  minus 
the total of any amounts shown on lines 
27,  28,  and  29;  Schedule  3,  lines  9,  12, 
13b,  and  13h;  and  Forms  8828,  4137, 
5329  (Parts  III  through  IX  only),  and 
8919. Also subtract from line 24 any:

• Tax  on  an  excess  parachute  pay-

ment,

• Excise  tax  on  insider  stock  com-
pensation of an expatriated corporation,
• Uncollected  social  security  and 
Medicare  or  RRTA  tax  on  tips  or 
group-term life insurance, and

• Look-back  interest  due  under  sec-

tion 167(g) or 460(b).
When  figuring  the  amount  on  line  24, 
include  household  employment  taxes 
only if line 25d is more than zero or you 
would owe the penalty even if you didn't 
include those taxes.
Exception.  You  won't  owe  the  penalty 
if  your  2021  tax  return  was  for  a  tax 
year of 12 full months and either of the 
following applies.

1. You  had  no  tax  shown  on  your 
2021 return and you were a U.S. citizen 
or resident for all of 2021.

2. The  total  of  lines  25d,  26,  and 
Schedule 3, line 11, on your 2022 return 
is  at  least  100%  of  the  tax  shown  on 
your  2021  return  (110%  of  that  amount 
if  you  aren't  a  farmer  or  fisherman,  and 

income 

your  adjusted  gross 
(AGI) 
shown  on  your  2021  return  was  more 
than  $150,000  (more  than  $75,000  if 
married  filing  separately  for  2022)). 
Your  estimated  tax  payments  for  2022 
must  have  been  made  on  time  and  for 
the required amount.

For  most  people,  the  “tax  shown  on 
your 2021 return” is the amount on your 
2021  Form  1040  or  1040-SR,  line  24, 
minus  the  total  of  any  amounts  shown 
on lines 27a, 28, 29, and 30; Schedule 3, 
lines  9,  12,  13b,  13g,  and  13h;  and 
Forms  8828,  4137,  5329  (Parts  III 
through IX only), 8885, and 8919. Also 
subtract from line 24 any:

• Tax  on  an  excess  parachute  pay-

ment,

• Excise  tax  on  insider  stock  com-
pensation of an expatriated corporation,
• Uncollected  social  security  and 
Medicare  or  RRTA  tax  on  tips  or 
group-term life insurance, and

• Look-back  interest  due  under  sec-

tion 167(g) or 460(b).
When  figuring  the  amount  on  line  24, 
include  household  employment  taxes 
only if line 25d is more than zero or you 
would have owed the estimated tax pen-
alty  for  2021  even  if  you  didn't  include 
those taxes.

If 

the  Exception 

just  described 
doesn't  apply,  see  the  Instructions  for 
Form 2210 for other situations in which 
you  may  be  able  to  lower  your  penalty 
by filing Form 2210.

Figuring the Penalty

If you choose to figure the penalty your-
self, use Form 2210 (or 2210-F for farm-
ers and fishermen).

Enter any penalty on line 38. Add the 
penalty to any tax due and enter the total 
on line 37.

However,  if  you  have  an  overpay-
ment  on  line  34,  subtract  the  penalty 
from  the  amount  you  would  otherwise 
enter  on  line  35a  or  line  36.  Lines  35a, 
36, and 38 must equal line 34.

If  the  penalty  is  more  than  the  over-
payment  on  line  34,  enter  -0-  on  lines 
35a and 36. Then, subtract line 34 from 
line 38 and enter the result on line 37.

Don’t  file  Form  2210  with  your  re-
turn unless Form 2210 indicates that you 
must do so. Instead, keep it for your re-
cords.

Because  Form  2210  is  compli-
cated,  you  can  leave  line  38 
blank  and  the  IRS  will  figure 
the  penalty  and  send  you  a  bill.  We 
won't charge you interest on the penalty 
if  you  pay  by  the  date  specified  on  the 
bill.  If  your  income  varied  during  the 
year,  the  annualized  income  installment 
method  may  reduce  the  amount  of  your 
penalty.  But  you  must  file  Form  2210 
because the IRS can't figure your penal-
ty under this method.

Third Party Designee
If  you  want  to  allow  your  preparer,  a 
friend,  a  family  member,  or  any  other 
person you choose to discuss your 2022 
tax return with the IRS, check the “Yes” 
box  in  the  “Third  Party  Designee”  area 
of your return. Also enter the designee's 
name, phone number, and any five digits 
the  designee  chooses  as  their  personal 
identification number (PIN).

If you check the “Yes” box, you, and 
your  spouse  if  filing  a  joint  return,  are 
authorizing  the  IRS  to  call  the  designee 
to  answer  any  questions  that  may  arise 
during  the  processing  of  your  return. 
You are also authorizing the designee to:
• Give  the  IRS  any  information  that 

is missing from your return;

• Call the IRS for information about 
the processing of your return or the sta-
tus of your refund or payment(s);

• Receive  copies  of  notices  or  tran-
scripts  related  to  your  return,  upon  re-
quest; and

• Respond  to  certain  IRS  notices 
about  math  errors,  offsets,  and  return 
preparation.

You  aren't  authorizing  the  designee 
to receive any refund check, bind you to 
anything  (including  any  additional  tax 
liability), or otherwise represent you be-
fore the IRS. If you want to expand the 
designee's authorization, see Pub. 947.

This  authorization  will  automatically 
end  no  later  than  the  due  date  (not 
counting  extensions)  for  filing  your 
2023  tax  return.  This  is  April  15,  2024, 
for most people.

cordance with the requirements in these 
instructions.  If  you  are  filing  a  joint  re-
turn, your spouse must also sign. If your 
spouse  can't  sign  the  return,  see  Pub. 
501. Be sure to date your return and en-
ter  your  occupation(s).  If  you  have 
someone  prepare  your  return,  you  are 
still  responsible  for  the  correctness  of 
the  return.  If  your  return  is  signed  by  a 
representative for you, you must have a 
power  of  attorney  attached  that  specifi-
cally  authorizes  the  representative  to 
sign your return. To do this, you can use 
Form  2848.  If  you  are  filing  a  joint  re-
turn with your spouse who died in 2022, 
see Death of a Taxpayer, later.

Court-Appointed 
Conservator, Guardian, or 
Other Fiduciary
If you are a court-appointed conservator, 
guardian,  or  other  fiduciary  for  a  men-
tally or physically incompetent individu-
al  who  has  to  file  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR,  sign  your  name  for  the  indi-
vidual and file Form 56.

Child's Return
If  your  child  can't  sign  their  return,  ei-
ther  parent  can  sign  the  child's  name  in 
the  space  provided.  Then,  enter  “By 
(your  signature),  parent 
for  minor 
child.”

Requirements for a Paper 
Return
You  must  handwrite  your  signature  on 
your return if you file it on paper. Digi-
tal,  electronic,  or  typed-font  signatures 
are  not  valid  signatures  for  Forms  1040 
or 1040-SR filed on paper.

Requirements for an 
Electronic Return
To  file  your  return  electronically,  you 
must sign the return electronically using 
a  personal  identification  number  (PIN) 
and  provide  the  information  described 
below.  If  you  are  filing  online  using 
software,  you  must  use  a  Self-Select 
PIN.  If  you  are  filing  electronically  us-
ing  a  tax  practitioner,  you  can  use  a 
Self-Select  PIN  or  a  Practitioner  PIN. 
For  2022,  if  we  issued  you  an  identity 
protection  personal  identification  num-
ber (IP PIN) (as described in more detail 
below),  all  six  digits  of  your  IP  PIN 
must appear in the IP PIN spaces provi-

ded  next  to  the  space  for  your  occupa-
tion  for  your  electronic  signature  to  be 
complete. Failure to include an issued IP 
PIN  on  the  electronic  return  will  result 
in an invalid signature and a rejected re-
turn.  If  you  are  filing  a  joint  return  and 
both  taxpayers  were  issued  an  IP  PIN, 
enter  both  IP  PINs  in  the  spaces  provi-
ded.
Self-Select  PIN.  The  Self-Select  PIN 
method  allows  you  to  create  your  own 
PIN.  If  you  are  married  filing  jointly, 
you  and  your  spouse  will  each  need  to 
create  a  PIN  and  enter  these  PINs  as 
your electronic signatures.

A PIN is any combination of five dig-
its  you  choose  except  five  zeros.  If  you 
use  a  PIN,  there  is  nothing  to  sign  and 
nothing  to  mail—not  even  your  Forms 
W-2.

Your electronic return is considered a 
validly  signed  return  only  when  it  in-
cludes  your  PIN,  last  name,  date  of 
birth, IP PIN, if applicable, and your ad-
justed  gross  income  (AGI)  from  your 
originally filed 2021 federal income tax 
return,  if  applicable.  If  you're  filing 
jointly,  your  electronic  return  must  also 
include  your  spouse's  PIN,  last  name, 
date  of  birth,  IP  PIN,  if  applicable,  and 
AGI, if applicable, in order to be consid-
ered validly signed. Don’t use your AGI 
from an amended return (Form 1040-X) 
or  a  math  error  correction  made  by  the 
IRS.  AGI  is  the  amount  shown  on  your 
2021 Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 11. If 
you don’t have your 2021 income tax re-
turn, call the IRS at 800-908-9946 to get 
a  free  transcript  of  your  return  or  visit 
IRS.gov/Transcript.  (If  you  filed  elec-
tronically 
last  year,  you,  and  your 
spouse  if  filing  jointly,  may  use  your 
prior year PIN to verify your identity in-
stead  of  your  prior  year  AGI.  The  prior 
year  PIN  is  the  five-digit  PIN  you  used 
to electronically sign your 2021 return.)

You  can't  use  the  Self-Select 
PIN  method 
if  you  are  a 
first-time  filer  under  age  16  at 

the end of 2022.

Practitioner PIN.  The Practitioner PIN 
method allows you to authorize your tax 
practitioner  to  enter  or  generate  your 
PIN.  Your  electronic  return  is  consid-
ered a validly signed return only when it 
includes  your  PIN,  last  name,  date  of 
birth, and IP PIN, if applicable. If you're 

filing jointly, your electronic return must 
also  include  your  spouse's  PIN,  last 
name, date of birth, and IP PIN, if appli-
cable  in  order  to  be  considered  validly 
signed. The practitioner can provide you 
with details.
Form  8453.  You  must  send  in  a  paper 
Form 8453 if you have to attach certain 
forms  or  other  documents  that  can't  be 
electronically filed. See Form 8453.

Identity Protection 
PIN

All  taxpayers  are  now  eligible 
for  an  Identity  Protection  Per-
Identification  Number 
sonal 
(IP  PIN).  For  more  information,  see 
Pub. 5477. To apply for an IP PIN, go to 
IRS.gov/IPPIN  and  use  the  Get  an  IP 
PIN tool.

For  2022,  if  you  received  an  IP  PIN 
from  the  IRS,  enter  it  in  the  IP  PIN 
spaces  provided  next  to  the  space  for 
your occupation. You must correctly en-
ter  all  six  numbers  of  your  IP  PIN.  If 
you didn't receive an IP PIN, leave these 
spaces blank.

New IP PINs are generated ev-
ery year. They will generally be 
sent  out  by  mid-January  2023. 
Use this IP PIN on your 2022 return as 
well as any prior-year returns you file in 
2023.

If  you  are  filing  a  joint  return  and 
both  taxpayers  receive  an  IP  PIN,  enter 
both IP PINs in the spaces provided.

If  you  need  more  information,  go  to 
IRS.gov/IPPIN.  If  you  received  an  IP 
PIN but misplaced it, call 800-908-4490.

Phone Number and Email 
Address
You  have  the  option  of  entering  your 
phone  number  and  email  address  in  the 
spaces provided. There will be no effect 
on  the  processing  of  your  return  if  you 
choose  not  to  enter  this  information. 
Note that the IRS initiates most contacts 
through  regular  mail  delivered  by  the 
United States Postal Service.

ministration  at IRS  Impersonation  Scam

Paid Preparer Must 
Sign Your Return
Generally,  anyone  you  pay  to  prepare 
your return must sign it and include their 

Preparer  Tax 
Identification  Number 
(PTIN)  in  the  space  provided.  The  pre-
parer must give you a copy of the return 
for your records. Someone who prepares 
your  return  but  doesn't  charge  you 
shouldn’t sign your return.

If  your  paid  preparer  is  self-em-
ployed,  then  they  should  check  the 
“self-employed” checkbox.

Assemble Your 
Return
Assemble  any  schedules  and  forms  be-
hind Form 1040 or 1040-SR in order of 
the  “Attachment  Sequence  No.”  shown 
in the upper-right corner of the schedule 
or  form.  If  you  have  supporting  state-

ments, arrange them in the same order as 
the schedules or forms they support and 
attach them last. File your return, sched-
ules,  and  other  attachments  on  standard 
size paper. Cutting the paper may cause 
problems  in  processing  your  return. 
Don’t  attach  correspondence  or  other 
items  unless  required  to  do  so.  Attach 
Forms  W-2  and  2439  to  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR.  If  you  received  a  Form  W-2c 
(a  corrected  Form  W-2),  attach  your 
original  Forms  W-2  and  any  Forms 
W-2c.  Attach  Forms  W-2G  and  1099-R 
to  Form  1040  or  1040-SR  if  tax  was 
withheld.

How To Avoid Common 
Mistakes
Mistakes can delay your refund or result 
in notices being sent to you. One of the 
best ways to file an accurate return is to 
file electronically. Tax software does the 
math  for  you  and  will  help  you  avoid 
mistakes.  You  may  be  eligible  to  use 
free  tax  software  that  will  take  the 
guesswork out of preparing your return.

available 

• File your return on a standard size 
sheet  of  paper.  Cutting  the  paper  may 
cause  problems  in  processing  your  re-
turn.

• Make  sure  you  entered  the  correct 
name and social security number (SSN) 
for each dependent you claim in the De-
pendents  section.  Check  that  each  de-
pendent's name and SSN agrees with the 
dependent’s  social  security  card.  For 
each child under age 17 who is a quali-
fying  child  for  the  child  tax  credit  or 
each  dependent  who  qualifies  you  for 
the  credit  for  other  dependents,  make 
sure you checked the appropriate box in 
column (4) of the Dependents section.

• Check  your  math,  especially  for 
the child tax credit, earned income credit 
(EIC),  taxable  social  security  benefits, 
total  income,  itemized  deductions  or 
standard  deduction,  taxable  income,  to-
tal tax, federal income tax withheld, and 
refund or amount you owe.

• Be sure you used the correct meth-
od  to  figure  your  tax.  See  the  instruc-
tions for line 16.

• Be  sure  to  enter  your  SSN  in  the 
space provided on page 1 of Form 1040 
or  1040-SR.  If  you  are  married  filing  a

joint  or  separate  return,  also  enter  your 
spouse's SSN. Be sure to enter your SSN 
in  the  space  next  to  your  name.  Check 
that your name and SSN agree with your 
social security card.

• Make  sure  your  name  and  address 
are  correct.  Enter  your  (and  your  spou-
se's)  name  in  the  same  order  as  shown 
on your last return.

• If you live in an apartment, be sure 
to  include  your  apartment  number  in 
your address.

• If  you  are  taking  the  standard  de-
duction,  see  the  instructions  for  line  12 
to  be  sure  you  entered  the  correct 
amount.

• If  you  received  capital  gain  distri-
butions  but  weren't  required  to  file 
Schedule D, make sure you checked the 
box on line 7.

• If  you  are  taking  the  EIC,  be  sure 
you used the correct column of the EIC 
Table for your filing status and the num-
ber of qualifying children you have who 
have valid SSNs.

• Remember  to  sign  and  date  Form 
1040 or 1040-SR and enter your occupa-
tion(s).

• Attach your Form(s) W-2 and oth-
er required forms and schedules. Put all 
forms and schedules in the proper order. 
See Assemble Your Return, earlier.

• If  you  owe  tax  and  are  paying  by 
check or money order, be sure to include 
all the required information on your pay-
ment. See the instructions for line 37 for 
details.

• Make sure to check Where Do You 
File?  before  mailing  your  return.  Over 
the  next  several  years,  the  IRS  will  be 
reducing the number of paper tax return 
processing  sites.  Because  of  this,  you 
may need to mail your return to a differ-
ent address than you have in the past.

• Don’t  file  more  than  one  original 
return  for  the  same  year,  even  if  you 
haven't  gotten  your  refund  or  haven't 
heard from the IRS since you filed. Fil-
ing more than one original return for the 
same year, or sending in more than one 
copy  of  the  same  return  (unless  we  ask 
you to do so), could delay your refund.

• Make sure that if you, your spouse 
with whom you are filing a joint return, 
or your dependent was enrolled in Mar-
ketplace  coverage,  and  advance  pay-
ments  of  the  premium  tax  credit  were 
made  for  the  coverage,  that  you  attach 
Form  8962.  For  tax  years  other  than 
2020, you may have to repay excess ad-
vance  payments,  even  if  someone  else 
enrolled  you,  your  spouse,  or  your  de-
pendent  in  the  Marketplace  coverage. 
Excess advance payments may also have 
to  be  repaid  if  you  enrolled  someone  in 
Marketplace  coverage,  you  don't  claim 
that  individual  as  a  dependent,  and  no 
one  else  claims  that  individual  as  a  de-
pendent. See the instructions for Sched-
ule  2,  line  2,  and  the  Instructions  for 
Form  8962.  You  or  whoever  enrolled 
you should have received Form 1095-A 
from  the  Marketplace  with  information 
about who was covered and any advance 
payments of the premium tax credit.

Innocent Spouse Relief
Generally, both you and your spouse are 
each  responsible  for  paying  the  full 
amount of tax, interest, and penalties on 
your  joint  return.  However,  you  may 
qualify for relief from liability for tax on 
a  joint  return  if  (a)  there  is  an  under-
statement  of  tax  because  your  spouse 
omitted  income  or  claimed  false  deduc-
tions  or  credits;  (b)  you  are  divorced, 
separated, or no longer living with your 
spouse; or (c) given all the facts and cir-
cumstances,  it  wouldn't  be  fair  to  hold 
you  liable  for  the  tax.  You  may  also 
qualify  for  relief  if  you  were  a  married 
resident  of  a  community  property  state 
but didn't file a joint return and are now 
liable  for  an  unpaid  or  understated  tax. 
File  Form  8857  to  request  relief.  In 
some cases, Form 8857 may need to be 
filed within 2 years of the date on which 
the IRS first attempted to collect the tax 
from  you.  Don’t  file  Form  8857  with 
your  Form  1040  or  1040-SR.  For  more 
information,  see  Pub.  971  and  Form 
8857,  or  you  can  call  the  Innocent 
Spouse office toll free at 855-851-2009.

for  an  Identity  Protection  PIN

Identity  theft  occurs  when  someone 
uses  your  personal  information,  such  as 
your  name,  social  security  number 
(SSN),  or  other  identifying  information, 
without  your  permission 
to  commit 
fraud  or  other  crimes.  An  identity  thief 
may  use  your  SSN  to  get  a  job  or  may 
file  a  tax  return  using  your  SSN  to  re-
ceive a refund.

• Ensure your employer is protecting

How Do You Make a Gift 
To Reduce Debt Held By 
the Public?
If you wish to do so, make a check paya-
ble  to  “Bureau  of  the  Fiscal  Service.” 
You can send it to: Bureau of the Fiscal 
Service,  Attn:  Dept  G,  P.O.  Box  2188, 
Parkersburg,  WV  26106-2188.  Or  you 
can enclose the check with your income 
tax  return  when  you  file.  In  the  memo 
section of the check, make a note that it 
is  a  gift  to  reduce  the  debt  held  by  the 
public.  Don’t  add  your  gift  to  any  tax 
you  may  owe.  See  the  instructions  for 
line 37 for details on how to pay any tax 
you  owe.  For  information  on  how  to 
make  this  type  of  gift  online,  go  to 
TreasuryDirect.gov/Help-Center/Public-
Debt-FAQs/#DebtFinance  and  click  on 
“How do you make a contribution to re-
duce the debt?”

You may be able to deduct this 
gift on your 2023 tax return.

How Long Should 
Records Be Kept?
Keep  a  copy  of  your  tax  return,  work-
sheets you used, and records of all items 
appearing on it (such as Forms W-2 and 
1099) until the statute of limitations runs 
out  for  that  return.  Usually,  this  is  3 
years from the date the return was due or 
filed or 2 years from the date the tax was 
paid,  whichever  is  later.  You  should 
keep some records longer. For example, 
keep  property  records  (including  those 
on  your  home)  as  long  as  they  are  nee-
ded to figure the basis of the original or 
replacement  property.  For  more  details, 
see chapter 1 of Pub. 17.

you  already  filed.  Generally,  Form

ter the date the original return was filed 
or  within  2  years  after  the  date  the  tax 
was  paid,  whichever  is  later.  But  you 
may  have  more  time  to  file  Form 
1040-X  if  you  live  in  a  federally  de-
clared disaster area or you are physically 
or  mentally  unable  to  manage  your  fi-
nancial affairs. See Pub. 556 for details.

Use the Where's My Amended Return 
application  on  IRS.gov  to  track  the  sta-
tus  of  your  amended  return.  It  can  take 
up to 3 weeks from the date you mailed 
it to show up in our system.

Need a Copy of Your 
Tax Return Information?
Tax  return  transcripts  are  free  and  are 
generally  used  to  validate  income  and 
tax  filing  status  for  mortgage  applica-
tions,  student  and  small  business  loan 
applications, and during tax return prep-
aration. To get a free transcript:
• Visit IRS.gov/Transcript,
• Use Form 4506-T or 4506T-EZ, or
• Call us at 800-908-9946.
If you need a copy of your actual tax 
return, use Form 4506. There is a fee for 
each  return  requested.  See  Form  4506 
for  the  current  fee.  If  your  main  home, 
principal  place  of  business,  or  tax  re-
cords are located in a federally declared 
disaster area, this fee will be waived.

Death of a Taxpayer
If  a  taxpayer  died  before  filing  a  return 
for  2022,  the  taxpayer's  spouse  or  per-
sonal representative may have to file and 
sign a return for that taxpayer. A person-
al representative can be an executor, ad-
ministrator,  or  anyone  who  is  in  charge 
of  the  deceased  taxpayer's  property.  If 
the deceased taxpayer didn't have to file 
a  return  but  had  tax  withheld,  a  return 
must be filed to get a refund. The person 
who  files  the  return  must  enter  “De-
ceased,”  the  deceased  taxpayer's  name, 
and  the  date  of  death  across  the  top  of 
the return. If this information isn't provi-
ded,  it  may  delay  the  processing  of  the 
return.

If  your  spouse  died  in  2022  and  you 
didn't remarry in 2022, or if your spouse 
died  in  2023  before  filing  a  return  for 
2022, you can file a joint return. A joint 
return  should  show  your  spouse's  2022 
income  before  death  and  your  income 

for  all  of  2022.  Enter  “Filing  as  surviv-
ing  spouse”  in  the  area  where  you  sign 
the return. If someone else is the person-
al representative, they must also sign.

All  payers  of  income,  including  fi-
nancial  institutions,  should  be  promptly 
notified  of  the  taxpayer's  death.  This 
will  ensure  the  proper  reporting  of  in-
come  earned  by  the  taxpayer's  estate  or 
heirs.  A  deceased  taxpayer's  social  se-
curity  number  shouldn't  be  used  for  tax 
years  after  the  year  of  death,  except  for 
estate tax return purposes.

Claiming a Refund for a 
Deceased Taxpayer
If you are filing a joint return with your 
deceased  spouse,  you  only  need  to  file 
the tax return to claim the refund. If you 
are a court-appointed representative, file 
the return and include a copy of the cer-
tificate that shows your appointment. All 
other filers requesting the deceased tax-
payer's  refund  must  file  the  return  and 
attach Form 1310.

For  more  details,  use  Tax  Topic  356 

or see Pub. 559.

Past Due Returns
If  you  or  someone  you  know  needs  to 
file  past  due  tax  returns,  use  Tax  Topic 
153  or  go  to  IRS.gov/Individuals  for 
help in filing those returns. Send the re-
turn to the address that applies to you in 
the  latest  Form  1040  and  1040-SR  in-
structions. For example, if you are filing 
a 2019 return in 2023, use the address at 
the  end  of  these  instructions.  However, 
if you got an IRS notice, mail the return 
to the address in the notice.

to 

tion  required  for  the  preparer  to  accu-
rately  prepare  your  return.  Anyone  paid

to receive a tax refund is to file electron-
ically  and  choose  direct  deposit,  which 
securely  and  electronically 
transfers 
your  refund  directly  into  your  financial 
account.  Direct  deposit  also  avoids  the 
possibility that your check could be lost, 
stolen, destroyed, or returned undeliver-
able  to  the  IRS.  Eight  in  10  taxpayers

Reporting  and  resolving  your  tax-re-
lated identity theft issues. 

• Tax-related  identity  theft  happens 
when  someone  steals  your  personal  in-
formation  to  commit  tax  fraud.  Your 
taxes can be affected if your SSN is used 
to  file  a  fraudulent  return  or  to  claim  a 
refund or credit.

• The  IRS  doesn’t  initiate  contact 
with  taxpayers  by  email,  text  messages 
(including  shortened  links),  telephone 
calls, or social media channels to request 
or  verify  personal  or  financial  informa-
tion. This includes requests for personal 
identification  numbers  (PINs),  pass-

words,  or  similar  information  for  credit 
cards, banks, or other financial accounts.
• Go  to  IRS.gov/IdentityTheft,  the 
IRS Identity Theft Central webpage, for 
information on identity theft and data se-
curity  protection  for  taxpayers,  tax  pro-
fessionals,  and  businesses.  If  your  SSN 
has  been  lost  or  stolen  or  you  suspect 
you’re  a  victim  of  tax-related  identity 
theft,  you  can  learn  what  steps  you 
should take.

• Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP 
PIN).  IP  PINs  are  six-digit  numbers  as-
signed  to  taxpayers  to  help  prevent  the 
misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent fed-
eral income tax returns. When you have 
an  IP  PIN,  it  prevents  someone  else 
from  filing  a  tax  return  with  your  SSN. 
To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN.

rectly from your checking or savings ac-
count at no cost to you.

federal  taxes  using  tax  return  prepara-
tion software or through a tax professio-
nal.

answered on IRS.gov without visiting an 
IRS TAC. Go to IRS.gov/LetUsHelp for 
the topics people ask about most. If you 
still  need  help,  IRS  TACs  provide  tax 
help  when  a  tax  issue  can’t  be  handled 
online or by phone. All TACs now pro-
vide  service  by  appointment,  so  you’ll 
know  in  advance  that  you  can  get  the 
service  you  need  without  long  wait 
times.  Before  you  visit,  go  to  IRS.gov/

on “Local Offices.”

Interest and Penalties
You  don’t  have  to  figure  the  amount  of 
any  interest  or  penalties  you  may  owe. 
We will send you a bill for any amount 
due.

If  you  choose  to  include  interest  or 
penalties  (other  than  the  estimated  tax 
penalty) with your payment, identify and 
enter  the  amount  in  the  bottom  margin 
of Form 1040 or 1040-SR, page 2. Don’t 
include  interest  or  penalties  (other  than 
the estimated tax penalty) in the amount 
you  owe  on  line  37.  For  more  informa-
tion  on  the  estimated  tax  penalty,  see 
Line 38, earlier.

Interest
We will charge you interest on taxes not 
paid by their due date, even if an exten-
sion  of  time  to  file  is  granted.  We  will 
also charge you interest on penalties im-
posed  for  failure  to  file,  negligence, 
fraud, substantial or gross valuation mis-
statements,  substantial  understatements 
of tax, and reportable transaction under-
statements.  Interest  is  charged  on  the 
penalty  from  the  due  date  of  the  return 
(including extensions).

Penalties
Late filing.  If you don’t file your return 
by  the  due  date  (including  extensions), 
the penalty is usually 5% of the amount 
due  for  each  month  or  part  of  a  month 
your  return  is  late,  unless  you  have  a 
reasonable  explanation.  If  you  have  a 
reasonable explanation for filing late, in-
clude  it  with  your  return.  The  penalty 
can  be  as  much  as  25%  of  the  tax  due. 
The  penalty  is  15%  per  month,  up  to  a 
maximum of 75%, if the failure to file is 
fraudulent.  If  your  return  is  more  than 
60  days  late,  the  minimum  penalty  will 
be  $450  or  the  amount  of  any  tax  you 
owe, whichever is smaller.
Late  payment  of  tax.  If  you  pay  your 
taxes  late,  the  penalty  is  usually  1/2  of 
1%  of  the  unpaid  amount  for  each 

month  or  part  of  a  month  the  tax  isn't 
paid.  The  penalty  can  be  as  much  as 
25% of the unpaid amount. It applies to 
any unpaid tax on the return. This penal-
ty  is  in  addition  to  interest  charges  on 
late payments.
Frivolous  return.  In  addition  to  any 
other penalties, the law imposes a penal-
ty of $5,000 for filing a frivolous return. 
A  frivolous  return  is  one  that  doesn't 
contain information needed to figure the 
correct  tax  or  shows  a  substantially  in-
correct tax because you take a frivolous 
position  or  desire  to  delay  or  interfere 
with the tax laws. This includes altering 
or  striking  out  the  preprinted  language 
above  the  space  where  you  sign.  For  a 
list  of  positions  identified  as  frivolous, 
see Notice 2010-33, 2010-17 I.R.B. 609, 
available 
IRS.gov/irb/
2010-17_IRB#NOT-2010-33.
Other.  Other  penalties  can  be  imposed 
for,  among  other  things,  negligence, 
substantial  understatement  of  tax,  re-
portable transaction understatements, fil-
ing  an  erroneous  refund  claim,  and 
fraud.  Criminal  penalties  may  be  im-
posed for willful failure to file, tax eva-
sion, making a false statement, or identi-
ty theft. See Pub. 17 for details on some 
of these penalties.

Refund Information

To  check  the  status 
of  your  refund,  go 
to  IRS.gov/Refunds 
or  use  the  free  IRS2Go  app,  24  hours  a 
day,  7  days  a  week.  Information  about 
your  refund  will  generally  be  available 
within  24  hours  after  the  IRS  receives 
your e-filed return or 4 weeks after you 
mail  a  paper  return.  But  if  you  filed 
Form  8379  with  your  return,  allow  14 
weeks  (11  weeks  if  you  filed  electroni-
cally)  before  checking  your  refund  sta-
tus.

The  IRS  can’t  issue  refunds  before 
mid-February  2023  for  returns 
that 
claim  the  earned  income  credit  or  the 
additional  child  tax  credit.  This  delay 
applies  to  the  entire  refund,  not  just  the 
portion associated with these credits.

To  use  Where's  My  Refund, 
have  a  copy  of  your  tax  return 
handy.  You  will  need  to  enter 
the following information from your re-
turn:

• Your social security number (or in-
dividual  taxpayer  identification  num-

Additional Income

Line 1

Taxable Refunds, Credits, or 
Offsets of State and Local 
Income Taxes

None  of  your  refund  is  taxable 
if, in the year you paid the tax, 
you either (a) didn't itemize de-
ductions,  or  (b)  elected  to  deduct  state 
and  local  general  sales  taxes  instead  of 
state and local income taxes.

If  you  received  a  refund,  credit,  or 
offset  of  state  or  local  income  taxes  in 
2022, you may be required to report this 
amount.  If  you  didn't  receive  a  Form 
1099-G,  check  with  the  government 
agency  that  made  the  payments  to  you. 
Your 2022 Form 1099-G may have been 
made  available  to  you  only  in  an  elec-
tronic  format,  and  you  will  need  to  get 
instructions  from  the  agency  to  retrieve 
this  document.  Report  any  taxable  re-
fund you received even if you didn't re-
ceive Form 1099-G.

If you chose to apply part or all of the 
refund  to  your  2022  estimated  state  or 
local  income  tax,  the  amount  applied  is 
treated as received in 2022. If the refund 
was for a tax you paid in 2021 and you 

deducted state and local income taxes on 
your 2021 Schedule A, use the State and 
Local Income Tax Refund Worksheet in 
these  instructions  to  see  if  any  of  your 
refund is taxable.
Exception.  See Itemized Deduction Re-
coveries in Pub. 525 instead of using the 
State  and  Local  Income  Tax  Refund 
Worksheet in these instructions if any of 
the following applies.

1. You  received  a  refund  in  2022 

that is for a tax year other than 2021.

2. You  received  a  refund  other  than 
an income tax refund, such as a general 
sales  tax  or  real  property  tax  refund,  in 
2022  of  an  amount  deducted  or  credit 
claimed in an earlier year.

3. You  had  taxable  income  on  your 
2021  Form  1040  or  1040-SR,  line  15, 
but  no  tax  on  your  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR, line 16, because of the 0% tax 
rate  on  net  capital  gain  and  qualified 
dividends in certain situations.

4. Your 2021 state and local income 
tax  refund  is  more  than  your  2021  state 
and  local  income  tax  deduction  minus 
the  amount  you  could  have  deducted  as 
your  2021  state  and  local  general  sales 
taxes.

5. You  made  your  last  payment  of 
2021 estimated state or local income tax 
in 2022.

6. You  owed  alternative  minimum 

tax in 2021.

7. You  couldn't  use  the  full  amount 
of  credits  you  were  entitled  to  in  2021 
because the total credits were more than 
the  amount  shown  on  your  2021  Form 
1040 or 1040-SR, line 16.

8. You  could  be  claimed  as  a  de-

pendent by someone else in 2021.

9. You received a refund because of 
a  jointly  filed  state  or  local  income  tax 
return, but you aren't filing a joint 2022 
Form  1040  or  1040-SR  with  the  same 
person.

• Loss on certain corrective distribu-
tions of excess deferrals. See Retirement 
Plan Contributions in Pub. 525.

• Dividends  on  insurance  policies  if 
they exceed the total of all net premiums 
you paid for the contract.

• Recapture of a charitable contribu-
tion  deduction  relating  to  the  contribu-
tion  of  a  fractional  interest  in  tangible 
personal property. See Fractional Inter-
est  in  Tangible  Personal  Property  in 
Pub. 526. Interest and an additional 10% 
tax apply to the amount of the recapture. 
See  the  instructions  for  Schedule  2, 
line 17g.

• Recapture of a charitable contribu-
tion deduction if the charitable organiza-
tion  disposes  of  the  donated  property 
within  3  years  of  the  contribution.  See 
Recapture if no exempt use in Pub. 526.
• Taxable part of disaster relief pay-
ments.  See  Pub.  525  to  figure  the  taxa-
ble  part,  if  any.  If  any  of  your  disaster 
relief payment is taxable, attach a state-
ment  showing  the  total  payment  re-
ceived  and  how  you  figured  the  taxable 
part.

• Taxable  distributions  from  a  Cov-
erdell  education  savings  account  (ESA) 
or  a  qualified  tuition  program  (QTP). 
Distributions  from  these  accounts  may 
be  taxable  if  (a)  in  the  case  of  distribu-
tions  from  a  QTP,  they  are  more  than 
the  qualified  higher  education  expenses 
of the designated beneficiary in 2022 or, 
in the case of distributions from an ESA, 
they  are  more  than  the  qualified  educa-
tion  expenses  of  the  designated  benefi-
ciary in 2022; and (b) they were not in-
cluded  in  a  qualified  rollover.  Nontaxa-
ble  distributions  from  these  accounts 
don’t have to be reported on Form 1040 
or 1040-SR. This includes rollovers and 
qualified  higher  education  expenses  re-
funded  to  a  student  from  a  QTP  that 
were  recontributed  to  a  QTP  with  the 
same  designated  beneficiary  generally 
within  60  days  after  the  date  of  refund. 
See Pub. 970. 

You  may  have  to  pay  an  addi-
tional tax if you received a tax-
able distribution from a Cover-
dell ESA or a QTP. See the Instructions 
for Form 5329.

Nontaxable  income.  Don’t  report  any 
nontaxable income on line 8z. Examples 
of  nontaxable  income  include  the  fol-
lowing.

• Child support.
• Payments you received to help you 
pay  your  mortgage  loan  under  the  HFA 
Hardest Hit Fund or the Homeowner As-
sistance Fund.

• Any  Pay-for-Performance  Success 
Payments  that  reduce  the  principal  bal-
ance  of  your  home  mortgage  under  the 
Home  Affordable  Modification  Pro-
gram.

• Life  insurance  proceeds  received 
because  of  someone's  death  (other  than 
from certain employer-owned life insur-
ance contracts).

• Gifts  and  bequests.  However,  if 
you  received  a  gift  or  bequest  from  a 
foreign  person  (including  amounts  from 
foreign corporations and foreign partner-
ships  that  you  treated  as  gifts)  totaling 
more than $17,339, you may have to re-
port information about it on Form 3520, 
Part  IV.  See  the  Instructions  for  Form 
3520.
Form  1099-K  loss  reporting.  If  you 
sold a personal item at a loss, either re-
port  the  loss  on  Form  8949  or  report  it 
on  line  8z.  If  you  report  the  loss  on 
line 8z, enter the amount of the sale pro-
ceeds  from  Form  1099-K  on  line  8z.  In 
the  entry  space  next  to  line  8z  write 
“Form  1099-K  Personal  Item  Sold  at  a 
Loss”  and  also  enter  the  amount  of  the 
sale proceeds. For example, you bought 
a couch for $1,000 and sold it through a 
third-party  vendor  for  $700,  which  was 
reported  on  your  Form  1099-K.  In  the 
entry  space  next  to  line  8z  you  would 
write “Form 1099-K Personal Item Sold 
at  a  Loss  -  $700.”  See  the  instructions 
for line 24z.

If  you  sold  more  than  one  per-
sonal item at a loss or received 
more  than  one  Form  1099-K 
for personal items you sold at a loss, in 
the  entry  space  next  to  line  8z  write 
“Form(s)  1099-K  Personal  Items  Sold 
at a Loss” and enter the total amount of 
the sale proceeds on line 8z.

Incorrect  Form  1099-K.  If  you  re-
ceived  a  Form  1099-K  that  shows  pay-
ments you didn’t receive or is otherwise 
incorrect  and  you  can’t  get  it  corrected, 
enter the amount from Form 1099-K that 
was  incorrectly  reported  to  you  on 
line 8z. In the entry space next to line 8z 
write “Incorrect Form 1099-K” and also 
enter the amount that was incorrectly re-
ported  to  you.  For  example,  if  you  re-
ceived  a  Form  1099-K  that  incorrectly 
showed  $800  of  payments  to  you,  you 
would  enter  $800  on  line  8z  and  in  the 
entry  space  next  to  line  8z  you  would 
write  “Incorrect  Form  1099-K  -  $800.” 
See the instructions for line 24z.

Adjustments to 
Income

Line 11

Educator Expenses

If you were an eligible educator in 2022, 
you can deduct on line 11 up to $300 of 
qualified  expenses  you  paid  in  2022.  If 
you  and  your  spouse  are  filing  jointly 
and both of you were eligible educators, 
the  maximum  deduction  is  $600.  How-
ever,  neither  spouse  can  deduct  more 
than $300 of their qualified expenses on 
line 11. An eligible educator is a kinder-
garten through grade 12 teacher, instruc-
tor,  counselor,  principal,  or  aide  who 
worked in a school for at least 900 hours 
during a school year.

Qualified  expenses  include  ordinary 

and necessary expenses paid:

• For 

professional 

development 
courses  you  have  taken  related  to  the 
curriculum  you  teach  or  to  the  students 
you teach; or

• In  connection  with  books,  sup-
plies,  equipment  (including  computer 
equipment,  software,  and  services),  and 
other materials used in the classroom.

An  ordinary  expense  is  one  that  is 
common  and  accepted  in  your  educa-
tional field. A necessary expense is one 
that  is  helpful  and  appropriate  for  your 
profession  as  an  educator.  An  expense 
doesn’t have to be required to be consid-
ered necessary.

Line 17

Self-Employed Health Insurance 
Deduction

You  may  be  able  to  deduct  the  amount 
you  paid  for  health  insurance  for  your-
self,  your  spouse,  and  your  dependents. 
The insurance can also cover your child 
who  was  under  age  27  at  the  end  of 
2022,  even  if  the  child  wasn't  your  de-
pendent.  A  child  includes  your  son, 
daughter,  stepchild,  adopted  child,  or 
foster child (defined in Who Qualifies as 
Your  Dependent  in  the  Instructions  for 
Form 1040).

One of the following statements must 

be true.

• You were self-employed and had a 
net  profit  for  the  year  reported  on 
Schedule C or F.

• You  were  a  partner  with  net  earn-

ings from self-employment.

• You  used  one  of  the  optional 
methods  to  figure  your  net  earnings 
from self-employment on Schedule SE.

• You  received  wages  in  2022  from 
an  S  corporation  in  which  you  were  a 
more-than-2%  shareholder.  Health  in-
surance premiums paid or reimbursed by 

-88-

the S corporation are shown as wages on 
Form W-2.

The insurance plan must be establish-
ed  under  your  business.  Your  personal 
services  must  have  been  a  material  in-
come-producing  factor  in  the  business. 
If  you  are  filing  Schedule  C  or  F,  the 
policy  can  be  either  in  your  name  or  in 
the name of the business.

If you are a partner, the policy can be 
either in your name or in the name of the 
partnership. You can either pay the pre-
miums  yourself  or  your  partnership  can 
pay them and report them as guaranteed 
payments.  If  the  policy  is  in  your  name 
and you pay the premiums yourself, the 
partnership  must  reimburse  you  and  re-
port  the  premiums  as  guaranteed  pay-
ments.

If you are a more-than-2% sharehold-
er in an S corporation, the policy can be 
either in your name or in the name of the 
S  corporation.  You  can  either  pay  the 
premiums  yourself  or  the  S  corporation 
can pay them and report them as wages. 
If  the  policy  is  in  your  name  and  you 
pay the premiums yourself, the S corpo-
ration must reimburse you. You can de-
duct the premiums only if the S corpora-
tion  reports  the  premiums  paid  or  reim-
bursed as wages in box 1 of your Form 
W-2 in 2022 and you also report the pre-
mium  payments  or  reimbursements  as 
wages  on  Form  1040  or  1040-SR, 
line 1a.

But  if  you  were  also  eligible  to  par-
ticipate  in  any  subsidized  health  plan 
maintained by your or your spouse's em-
ployer for any month or part of a month 
in  2022,  amounts  paid  for  health  insur-
ance  coverage  for  that  month  can't  be 
used  to  figure  the  deduction.  Also,  if 
you were eligible for any month or part 
of  a  month  to  participate  in  any  subsi-
dized health plan maintained by the em-
ployer  of  either  your  dependent  or  your 
child  who  was  under  age  27  at  the  end 
of 2022, don’t use amounts paid for cov-
erage for that month to figure the deduc-
tion.

A  qualified  small  employer 
health  reimbursement  arrange-
ment  (QSEHRA)  is  considered 
to  be  a  subsidized  health  plan  main-
tained by an employer.

ticipate in a subsidized health plan main-

Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction Worksheet—Schedule 1, Line 17

1. Enter the total amount paid in 2022 for health insurance coverage established under your business
(or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder) for 2022 for you, your 
spouse, and your dependents. Your insurance can also cover your child who was under age 27 at 
the end of 2022, even if the child wasn't your dependent. But don’t include amounts for any month 
you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or amounts paid from

*If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, don’t enter your net profit. Instead, enter the amount 

from Schedule SE, line 4b.

**Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it doesn't include 
capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established, earned 
income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

tained  by  your  spouse's  employer  from 
September  30  through  December  31, 
you can't use amounts paid for health in-
surance coverage for September through 
December to figure your deduction.

Medicare  premiums  you  voluntarily 
pay  to  obtain  insurance  in  your  name 
that  is  similar  to  qualifying  private 
health  insurance  can  be  used  to  figure 
the  deduction.  Amounts  paid  for  health

cause you are a retired public safety of-
ficer  can't  be  used  to  figure  the  deduc-

the Self-Employed Health Insurance De-
duction  Worksheet  in  these  instructions

following applies.

• You  had  more  than  one  source  of 

income subject to self-employment tax.

• You file Form 2555.
• You  are  using  amounts  paid  for 
qualified  long-term  care  insurance  to 
figure the deduction.

Use  Pub.  974  instead  of  the  work-

If  you  made  payments  to  or  for  your 
spouse or former spouse under a divorce 
or  separation  agreement  entered  into  on 
or  before  December  31,  2018,  you  may 
be able to take this deduction. You can't 
take  a  deduction  for  alimony  payments 
you  made  to  or  for  your  spouse  if  you 
entered  into  your  divorce  or  separation 
agreement  after  December  31,  2018,  or 
if  you  entered  into  the  agreement  on  or 
before  December  31,  2018,  and  the 

agreement  was  changed  after  December 
31,  2018,  to  expressly  provide  that  ali-
mony  received  is  not  included  in  your 
former  spouse's  income.  Use  Tax  Topic 
452 or see Pub. 504.

On line 19c, enter the month and year of 
your  original  divorce  or  separation 
agreement  that  relates  to  this  deduction 
for alimony paid.

IRA Deduction

If  you  made  any  nondeductible 
contributions  to  a  traditional 
individual  retirement  arrange-
ment  (IRA)  for  2022,  you  must  report 
them on Form 8606.

You  no  longer  need  to  be 
younger  than  age  701/2  to  take 
a  deduction  for  your  contribu-

tions to an IRA.

If  you  made  contributions  to  a  tradi-
tional IRA for 2022, you may be able to 
take an IRA deduction. But you, or your 
spouse if filing a joint return, must have 
had  earned  income  to  do  so.  For  IRA 
purposes, earned income includes alimo-
ny  and  separate  maintenance  payments

reported  on  Schedule  1,  line  2a.  If  you 
were  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Armed 
Forces, earned income includes any non-
taxable combat pay you received. If you 
were  self-employed,  earned  income  is 
generally  your  net  earnings 
from 
self-employment  if  your  personal  serv-
ices  were  a  material  income-producing 
factor. For more details, see Pub. 590-A. 
A  statement  should  be  sent  to  you  by 
May  31,  2023,  that  shows  all  contribu-
tions to your traditional IRA for 2022.

Use the IRA Deduction Worksheet to 
figure  the  amount,  if  any,  of  your  IRA 
deduction.  But  read  the  following  list 
before you fill in the worksheet.

1. You  can't  deduct  contributions  to 
a Roth IRA. But you may be able to take 
the 
retirement  savings  contributions 
credit  (saver's  credit).  See  the  instruc-
tions for Schedule 3, line 4.

2.

If you are filing a joint return and 
you  or  your  spouse  made  contributions 
to both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA 
for  2022,  don’t  use  the  IRA  Deduction 
Worksheet in these instructions. Instead, 
see  Pub.  590-A  to  figure  the  amount,  if 
any, of your IRA deduction.

3. You  can’t  deduct  elective  defer-
rals  to  a  401(k)  plan,  403(b)  plan,  sec-
tion 457 plan, SIMPLE plan, or the fed-
eral Thrift Savings Plan. These amounts 
aren't  included  as  income  in  box  1  of 
your Form W-2.

4.

If you made contributions to your 
IRA in 2022 that you deducted for 2021, 
don’t include them in the worksheet.

5.

If  you  received  income  from  a 
nonqualified  deferred 
compensation 
plan  or  nongovernmental  section  457 
plan  that  is  included  in  box  1  of  your 

Form  W-2,  or  in  box  1  of  Form 
1099-NEC, don’t include that income on 
line  8  of  the  worksheet.  The  income 
should  be  shown  in  (a)  box  11  of  your 
Form  W-2,  (b)  box  12  of  your  Form 
W-2 with code Z, or (c) box 15 of Form 
1099-MISC. If it isn't, contact your em-
ployer or the payer for the amount of the 
income.

6. You must file a joint return to de-
duct contributions to your spouse's IRA. 
Enter  the  total  IRA  deduction  for  you 
and your spouse on line 20.

7. Don’t  include  rollover  contribu-
tions in figuring your deduction. Instead, 
see  the  instructions  for  Form  1040  or 
1040-SR, lines 4a and 4b.

8. Don't  include  trustees'  fees  that 
were  billed  separately  and  paid  by  you 
for your IRA.

9. Don’t  include  any  repayments  of 
qualified  reservist  distributions.  You 
can't  deduct  them.  For  information  on 
how  to  report  these  repayments,  see 
Qualified  reservist  repayments  in  Pub. 
590-A.

10. If the total of your IRA deduction 
on  line  20  plus  any  nondeductible  con-
tribution to your traditional IRAs shown 
on Form 8606 is less than your total tra-
ditional IRA contributions for 2022, see 
Pub. 590-A for special rules.

You  must  receive  at  least  a 
minimum  amount  from  your 
traditional  IRA  for  each  year 
starting with the year you reach age 72. 
If you don't receive that minimum distri-
bution  amount  in  the  year  you  become 
age  72,  you  must  receive  that  distribu-
tion by April 1 of the year following the 
year  you  become  age  72.  If  you  don’t, 

you  may  have  to  pay  a  50%  additional 
tax on the amount that should have been 
distributed.  For  details,  including  how 
to figure the minimum required distribu-
tion, see Pub. 590-B.

Were  You  Covered  by  a  Retirement 
Plan? 
If you were covered by a retirement plan 
(qualified  pension,  profit-sharing  (in-
cluding 401(k)), annuity, SEP, SIMPLE, 
etc.)  at  work  or  through  self-employ-
ment,  your  IRA  deduction  may  be  re-
duced  or  eliminated.  But  you  can  still 
make  contributions  to  an  IRA  even  if 
you  can't  deduct  them.  In  any  case,  the 
income  earned  on  your  IRA  contribu-
tions isn't taxed until it is paid to you.

The “Retirement plan” box in box 13 
of your Form W-2 should be checked if 
you  were  covered  by  a  plan  at  work 
even  if  you  weren’t  vested  in  the  plan. 
You  are  also  covered  by  a  plan  if  you 
were  self-employed  and  had  a  SEP, 
SIMPLE, or qualified retirement plan.

If  you  were  covered  by  a  retirement 
plan and you file Form 2555 or 8815, or 
you  exclude  employer-provided  adop-
tion  benefits,  see  Pub.  590-A  to  figure 
the  amount,  if  any,  of  your  IRA  deduc-
tion.

Married persons filing separately.  If 
you  weren’t  covered  by  a  retirement 
plan  but  your  spouse  was,  you  are  con-
sidered  covered  by  a  plan  unless  you

Form  1099-K  loss  reporting.  If  you

did  not  report  the  loss  on  Form  8949, 
enter  the  amount  of  the  sale  proceeds 
from Form 1099-K on line 24z that you 
reported  on  line  8z.  In  the  entry  space 
next  to  line  24z  write  “Form  1099-K 
Personal  Item  Sold  at  a  Loss”  and  also 
enter  the  amount  of  the  sale  proceeds. 
For  example,  you  bought  a  couch  for 
$1,000  and  sold  it  through  a  third-party 
vendor for $700, which was reported on 
your  Form  1099-K.  On  line  24z  you 
would enter $700 and in the entry space 
next to line 24z you would write “Form 
1099-K  Personal  Item  Sold  at  a  Loss  -
$700.” See the instructions for line 8z.

If  you  sold  more  than  one  per-
sonal item at a loss or received 
more  than  one  Form  1099-K 
for  personal  items  you  sold  at  a  loss, 
and you entered the total amount of sale 
proceeds on line 8z, you should also en-
ter the total amount of sale proceeds on 
line 24z.

Incorrect  Form  1099-K.  If  you  re-
ceived  a  Form  1099-K  that  shows  pay-
ments you didn't receive or is otherwise 
incorrect  and  you  can't  get  it  corrected, 
enter the amount on line 24z that you re-
ported on line 8z. In the entry space next 
to 
line  24z  write  “Incorrect  Form 
1099-K”  and  also  enter  the  amount  that 
was incorrectly reported to you. For ex-
ample,  if  you  received  a  Form  1099-K 
that  incorrectly  showed  $800  of  pay-
ments  to  you,  you  would  enter  $800  on 
line  24z  and  in  the  entry  space  next  to 
line  24z  you  would  write  “Incorrect 
Form  1099-K  -  $800.”  See  the  instruc-
tions for line 8z.

Disclosure, Privacy Act, and Paperwork Reduction Act Notice

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 
1998,  the  Privacy  Act  of  1974,  and  the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 require 
that when we ask you for information we 
must  first  tell  you  our  legal  right  to  ask 
for  the  information,  why  we  are  asking 
for  it,  and  how  it  will  be  used.  We  must 
also tell you what could happen if we do 
not  receive  it  and  whether  your  response 
is  voluntary,  required  to  obtain  a  benefit, 
or mandatory under the law.

This  notice  applies  to  all  records  and 
other material (in paper or electronic for-
mat)  you  file  with  us,  including  this  tax 
return. It also applies to any questions we 
need to ask you so we can complete, cor-
rect,  or  process  your  return;  figure  your 
tax; and collect tax, interest, or penalties.

Our  legal  right  to  ask  for  information 
is  Internal  Revenue  Code  sections  6001, 
6011,  and  6012(a),  and  their  regulations. 
They  say  that  you  must  file  a  return  or 
statement with us for any tax you are lia-
ble for. Your response is mandatory under 
these  sections.  Code  section  6109  re-
quires  you  to  provide  your  identifying 
number on the return. This is so we know 
who you are, and can process your return 
and other papers. You must fill in all parts 
of the tax form that apply to you. But you 
do  not  have  to  check  the  boxes  for  the 
Presidential  Election  Campaign  Fund  or 
for  the  third-party  designee.  You  also  do 
not  have  to  provide  your  daytime  phone 
number or email address.

You are not required to provide the in-
formation requested on a form that is sub-
ject  to  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act  un-
less  the  form  displays  a  valid  OMB  con-
trol number. Books or records relating to 
a form or its instructions must be retained 
as long as their contents may become ma-
terial in the administration of any Internal 
Revenue law.

We  ask  for  tax  return  information  to 
carry  out  the  tax  laws  of  the  United 
States.  We  need  it  to  figure  and  collect 
the right amount of tax.

If you do not file a return, do not pro-
vide  the  information  we  ask  for,  or  pro-
vide  fraudulent  information,  you  may  be 
charged penalties and be subject to crimi-
nal prosecution. We may also have to dis-
allow the exemptions, exclusions, credits, 
deductions,  or  adjustments  shown  on  the 

tax return. This could make the tax higher 
or delay any refund. Interest may also be 
charged.

Generally, tax returns and return infor-
mation are confidential, as stated in Code 
section  6103.  However,  Code  section 
6103 allows or requires the Internal Reve-
nue Service to disclose or give the infor-
mation shown on your tax return to others 
as  described  in  the  Code.  For  example, 
we  may  disclose  your  tax  information  to 
the  Department  of  Justice  to  enforce  the 
tax  laws,  both  civil  and  criminal,  and  to 
cities,  states,  the  District  of  Columbia, 
and  U.S.  commonwealths  or  possessions 
to  carry  out  their  tax  laws.  We  may  dis-
close your tax information to the Depart-
ment  of  Treasury  and  contractors  for  tax 
administration purposes; and to other per-
sons  as  necessary  to  obtain  information 
needed  to  determine  the  amount  of  or  to 
collect the tax you owe. We may disclose 
your  tax  information  to  the  Comptroller 
General of the United States to permit the 
Comptroller  General  to  review  the  Inter-
nal  Revenue  Service.  We  may  disclose 
your  tax  information  to  committees  of 
Congress;  federal,  state,  and  local  child 
support  agencies;  and  to  other  federal 
agencies  for  the  purposes  of  determining 
entitlement  for  benefits  or  the  eligibility 
for  and  the  repayment  of  loans.  We  may 
also  disclose  this  information  to  other 
countries under a tax treaty, to federal and 
state  agencies  to  enforce  federal  nontax 
criminal  laws,  or  to  federal  law  enforce-
ment and intelligence agencies to combat 
terrorism.

Please  keep  this  notice  with  your  re-
cords.  It  may  help  you  if  we  ask  you  for 
other  information.  If  you  have  questions 
about the rules for filing and giving infor-
mation,  please  call  or  visit  any  Internal 
Revenue Service office.

We Welcome Comments on 
Forms
We  try  to  create  forms  and  instructions 
that  can  be  easily  understood.  Often  this 
is difficult to do because our tax laws are 
very  complex.  For  some  people  with  in-
come  mostly  from  wages,  filling  in  the 
forms  is  easy.  For  others  who  have  busi-
nesses, pensions, stocks, rental income, or 
other investments, it is more difficult.

If  you  have  suggestions  for  making 
these  forms  simpler,  we  would  be  happy 
to  hear  from  you.  You  can  send  us  com-
ments  through  IRS.gov/FormsComments. 
Or you can send your comments to Inter-
nal Revenue Service, Tax Forms and Pub-
lications  Division,  1111  Constitution 
Ave.  NW,  IR-6526,  Washington,  DC 
20224. Don’t send your return to this ad-
dress. Instead, see the addresses at the end 
of these instructions.

Although we can't respond individual-
ly  to  each  comment  received,  we  do  ap-
preciate  your  feedback  and  will  consider 
your  comments  as  we  revise  our  tax 
forms and instructions.

Estimates of Taxpayer 
Burden
The  following  table  shows  burden  esti-
mates  based  on  current  statutory  require-
ments as of November 2022 for taxpayers 
filing  a  2022  Form  1040  or  1040-SR  tax 
return.  Time  spent  and  out-of-pocket 
costs  are  presented  separately.  Time  bur-
den  is  broken  out  by  taxpayer  activity, 
with recordkeeping representing the larg-
est  component.  Out-of-pocket  costs  in-
clude any expenses incurred by taxpayers 
to  prepare  and  submit  their  tax  returns. 
Examples  include  tax  return  preparation 
and  submission  fees,  postage  and  photo-
copying  costs,  and  tax  return  preparation 
software  costs.  While  these  estimates 
don’t  include  burden  associated  with 
post-filing activities, IRS operational data 
indicate  that  electronically  prepared  and 
filed returns have fewer arithmetic errors, 
implying lower post-filing burden.

Reported time and cost burdens are na-
tional  averages  and  don’t  necessarily  re-
flect a “typical” case. Most taxpayers ex-
perience lower than average burden, with 
taxpayer  burden  varying  considerably  by 
taxpayer type. For instance, the estimated 
average time burden for all taxpayers fil-
ing a Form 1040 or 1040-SR is 13 hours, 
with  an  average  cost  of  $250  per  return. 
This average includes all associated forms 
and schedules, across all tax return prepa-
ration methods and taxpayer activities.

Within  this  estimate,  there  is  signifi-
cant variation in taxpayer activity. For ex-
ample,  nonbusiness  taxpayers  are  expec-
ted to have an average burden of about 8

Major Categories of Federal Income and Outlays for Fiscal Year 2021

On or before the first Monday in February 
of each year, the President is required by 
law  to  submit  to  the  Congress  a  budget 
proposal for the fiscal year that begins the 
following  October.  The  budget  plan  sets 
forth  the  President's  proposed  receipts, 
spending,  and  the  surplus  or  deficit  for 
the federal government. The plan includes 
recommendations  for  new  legislation  as 
well as recommendations to change, elim-
inate,  and  add  programs.  After  receipt  of 
the President's proposal, the Congress re-
views the proposal and makes changes. It 
first passes a budget resolution setting its 
own targets for receipts, outlays, and sur-
plus  or  deficit.  Next,  individual  spending 
and  revenue  bills  that  are  consistent  with 
the  goals  of  the  budget  resolution  are 
enacted.

In  fiscal  year  2021  (which  began  on 
October 1, 2020, and ended on September 

30, 2021), federal income was $4.047 tril-
lion  and  outlays  were  $6.882  trillion, 
leaving a deficit of $2.775 trillion.

Footnotes for Certain Federal 
Outlays

1. Social  security,  Medicare,  and 
other  retirement:  These  programs  pro-
vide  income  support  for  the  retired  and 
disabled and medical care for the elderly.

2. National  defense,  veterans,  and 
foreign  affairs:  About  11%  of  outlays 
were  to  equip,  modernize,  and  pay  our 
armed forces and to fund national defense 
activities;  about  3%  were  for  veterans 
benefits and services; and about 1% were 
for international activities, including mili-
tary  and  economic  assistance  to  foreign 

countries  and  the  maintenance  of  U.S. 
embassies abroad.

3. Physical,  human,  and  communi-
ty  development:  These  outlays  were  for 
agriculture;  natural  resources;  environ-
ment;  transportation;  aid  for  elementary 
and secondary education and direct assis-
tance to college students; job training; de-
posit  insurance,  commerce  and  housing 
credit,  and  community  development;  and 
space,  energy,  and  general  science  pro-
grams.

4. Social  programs:  About  22%  of 
total  outlays  were  for  Medicaid,  Supple-
mental  Nutrition  Assistance  Program 
(formerly  food  stamps),  temporary  assis-
tance for needy families, supplemental se-
curity income, and related programs; and 
11% for health research and public health 
programs,  unemployment  compensation, 
assisted housing, and social services.

Note. The percentages shown here exclude undistributed offsetting receipts, which were $124 billion in fiscal year 2021. In the budget, these receipts are offset against spending in figuring the outlay totals shown above. 
These receipts are for the U.S. Government's share of its employee retirement programs, rents and royalties on the Outer Continental Shelf, and proceeds from the sale of assets.

2024-05-27 21:13:36,485 - app - INFO - Response from model: No, if you are using `gunicorn` to run your application, you should update the "Run Command" in the Digital Ocean control panel to match the command specified in your `Procfile`.

Since you updated your `Procfile` to use `gunicorn` with the following line:

```
web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

You should update the "Run Command" in the Digital Ocean control panel to:

```
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

This command instructs `gunicorn` to run your Flask application defined in the `app.py` file, binding it to the `0.0.0.0` host and the port specified by the `$PORT` environment variable.

Make sure to save the changes in the Digital Ocean control panel after updating the "Run Command".

By aligning the "Run Command" with the `Procfile` command, you ensure that your application is started correctly using `gunicorn` in the Digital Ocean environment.

Remember to redeploy your application after making these changes for them to take effect.

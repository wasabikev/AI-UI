        "content": "Of course! The quadratic formula is a powerful tool that allows you to find the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\).\n\nThe quadratic formula is:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}\n\\]\n\nHere's a breakdown of the formula:\n\n- \\( -b \\) is the opposite of the coefficient \\( b \\).\n- \\( \\pm \\) means that there will be two solutions: one with a plus and one with a minus.\n- \\( \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}} \\) is the square root of the discriminant, which is \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). The discriminant can tell you about the nature of the roots:\n  - If \\( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \\), there are two real and distinct solutions.\n  - If \\( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\), there is one real solution (the roots are the same).\n  - If \\( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \\), there are no real solutions; instead, there are two complex solutions.\n- \\( 2a \\) is two times the coefficient \\( a \\).\n\nWould you like to go through an example of using the quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation?",

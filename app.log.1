        "content": "Certainly! When you're multiplying expressions with exponents that have the same base, you add the exponents together. In this case, both terms have the base of \\(m\\), so you can apply this rule. Additionally, you also multiply the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) together.\n\nLet's break down the expression \\(2m^2 \\times 2m^3\\):\n\nFirst, multiply the coefficients (the numbers in front of the \\(m\\)):\n\\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n\nNext, apply the rule for multiplying exponents with the same base (in this case, the base is \\(m\\)):\n\\(m^2 \\times m^3\\)\n\nSince the base \\(m\\) is the same, you add the exponents:\n\\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n\nSo, \\(m^2 \\times m^3 = m^{2+3} = m^5\\)\n\nNow, combine the result of the coefficients with the result of the variables:\n\\(4m^5\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(2m^2 \\times 2m^3 = 4m^5\\).\n\nThis expression tells you that you have four times the fifth power of \\(m\\). It's a way of combining like terms with exponents by using the properties of exponents to simplify the expression. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",

The quadratic formula is a powerful tool that allows you to find the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are coefficients and \\( a \\neq 0 \\). The formula is:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nLet\'s break it down a bit:\n\n- The symbol \\( \\pm \\) means "plus or minus," which indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions: one where you add the square root term, and one where you subtract it.\n- The term \\( b^2 - 4ac \\) under the square root is called the discriminant. It can tell you a lot about the nature of the roots:\n  - If the discriminant is positive, you\'ll get two real and distinct solutions.\n  - If the discriminant is zero, you\'ll get exactly one real solution (since both solutions are the same).\n  - If the discriminant is negative, you\'ll get two complex solutions.\n\nWould you like to go through an example of how to use the quadratic formula, or do you have any specific questions about it?', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Please provide some sample html code'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Certainly!

This federal law prohibits a state from imposing a net income tax on a foreign corporation if the only activities conducted within the state are limited to solicitation of orders for the sale of tangible personal property.\n\nIn this case, the operating partnership is an entity that is separate from its owners, so it will have its own filing obligations and fees in New Jersey. The partnership should file a New Jersey Partnership Return (Form NJ-1065) and pay the corresponding filing fee based on its total income. The current filing fee for the New Jersey Partnership Return is $150.\n\nNow, let's move on to the S Corporation that owns 99% of the operating partnership. As an S Corporation, it is a pass-through entity, and its income is generally not subject to New Jersey income tax at the entity level. Instead, the income is allocated to its shareholders, who will report it on their individual New Jersey income tax returns.\n\nThe S Corporation will still have to file a New Jersey S Corporation Return (Form CBT-100S) to report its income and provide information on its shareholders. The filing fee for the New Jersey S Corporation Return is $150.\n\nThe nonresident individuals who receive guaranteed payments for capital only should also be aware of their New Jersey filing obligations, as they may have to report their share of the partnership income on their individual New Jersey income tax returns.\n\nIt's important to note that tax laws and filing requirements can be complex, so it's always advisable to consult with a qualified tax professional who has experience in New Jersey tax matters to ensure compliance with all applicable rules and regulations."}]

"""
This module is a future extension point for orchestrating web content extraction.
Traditional Scrapy-based scraping logic has been removed in favor of planned
AI-powered content extraction (e.g., via Firecrawl or similar).

Add implementation here when ready to support Firecrawl/web content orchestration.

I'm testing the ability for the UI to properly display math content."}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Of course! Let's start with a simple algebra problem that involves solving for an unknown variable. Here's the problem:\n\nSolve for \\( x \\) in the equation \\( 3x + 7 = 22 \\).\n\nNow, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The goal is to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. To do this, we first need to get rid of the 7 that is added to \\( 3x \\). We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation.\n\n2. When we subtract 7 from both sides, the equation becomes \\( 3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7 \\), which simplifies to \\( 3x = 15 \\).\n\n3. Now, we have \\( 3x \\) equal to 15. To find the value of \\( x \\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3.\n\n4. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us \\( \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{15}{3} \\), which simplifies to \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nSo, the solution to the equation \\( 3x + 7 = 22 \\) is \\( x = 5 \\).\n\nI hope the formatting of the math content is clear for you! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}]

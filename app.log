2023-09-18 11:16:28,970 - app - INFO - Responding with formatted chat output: I'd be happy to guide you through the process of uploading your project to GitHub. Here are some general steps:

<ol>1. Install Git: If it's not already installed in your PC, download and install Git from the official website.</ol> 

<ol>2. Signup & Create a Repository on GitHub: If you've not already, create an account on Github and create a new repository.</ol>

<ol>3. Initialize git in your local project: Go to your project's directory by command-line interface and type `git init`.</ol> It initializes a new git repository locally. You can view hidden files in your project directory to verify.

<ol>4. Configure your GitHub credentials: Execute the following commands in the terminal, replacing `your_username` and `your_email` with your actual GitHub username and email.</ol> These identify you as the author of commits.
```
git config --global user.name "your_username"
git config --global user.email "your_email"
```
<ol>5. Connect GitHub Repo: From GitHub, copy the HTTPS URL of your created repository and set it as the remote repository for your local repository with this command: 
```
git remote add origin https://github.</ol>com/your_username/repo_name.git
```
<ol>6. Commit your project: Pass the commands below.</ol> First, to track the files in the project: `git add .` Then, to commit and save the snapshot of the current state of the project: `git commit -m "your message here"`. The message describes the reason for the specific snapshot.

<ol>7. Push to GitHub: After committing your project, push your repository to GitHub using 
```
git push origin main
```
or 
```
git push origin master
```
(Use `main` or `master` depending on what default branch your repository is set to use.</ol>)

<ol>8. For subsequent commits and pushes, all you need is the `git add .</ol>` , `git commit -m "your message here"` , `git push origin main/master` sequence.

That's it. Now you've uploaded your project to GitHub and you can enjoy version control, show your work to the world and build upon it for your AI assistant project.

Git and Github offer much more - forking, branching, pull requests, and a ton of other features that are useful for collaboration and maintaining large projects. As you use GitHub more, you'll likely pick up these features as needed.

As you begin developing your context aware code assistant based on LLM technology, you might have more specific needs in terms of version control and collaboration. Some best practices include committing often, writing clear commit messages, and using branches for developing new features or experiments. Do not hesitate to ask for assistance as you start working on those parts.

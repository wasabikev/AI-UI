2024-05-27 21:09:57,991 - app - INFO - Response from model: Yes, you can install `gunicorn` using `pip`. Here's how you can add it to your project:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project's root directory.

3. Activate your virtual environment (if you're using one).

4. Run the following command to install `gunicorn`:
   ```
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

5. Once the installation is complete, update your `requirements.txt` file to include `gunicorn`. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
   This command will generate a list of all the installed packages and their versions in the `requirements.txt` file.

6. Commit the updated `requirements.txt` file to your version control system (e.g., Git).

7. Update your `Procfile` to use `gunicorn` instead of `flask run`:
   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
   ```

8. Deploy your application with the updated `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` file.

By installing `gunicorn` and updating your `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` file, you ensure that `gunicorn` is available in your production environment when deploying your application.

Remember to test your application locally with `gunicorn` to ensure that it runs correctly before deploying it to your production environment.

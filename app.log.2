Python:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
        return fib

print(fibonacci(10))
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
    str = str.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
    let left = 0;
    let right = str.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (str[left] !== str[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;

console.log(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"));

Markdown:
# Welcome to My Blog

## Introduction
This is a sample blog post written in **Markdown**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write.

## Features
- It supports *italics* and **bold** text
- You can create lists, like this one
- It allows you to add [links](https://www.example.com)
- You can also add images: ![Alt Text](image.jpg)

## Code Blocks
Markdown also supports code blocks, which is great for showcasing code snippets:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Conclusion
That's a brief overview of what you can do with Markdown. It's a versatile and user-friendly language for creating formatted text.

This sample output includes Python code for generating Fibonacci numbers, JavaScript code for checking if a string is a palindrome, and a Markdown document showcasing various formatting options such as headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks.
